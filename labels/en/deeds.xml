<label key="key:620759184:118018273" value="A section of the introduction, this page suggests that the author was neither modest nor the type to shy from a fight. She was apparently overly fond of causing trouble at inns throughout Eriador, sometimes going so far as to cheat openly at dice in order to provoke a fight."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018274" value="This page describes some of the author's favourite knives. It seems that she had an Elf-smith make blades for her as custom pieces which she particularly preferred for their speed and edge. She must have treated them rather roughly, given the sheer number of knives she describes in loving detail."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018275" value="The author appears to have preferred combat with an unusual level of intensity compared to what one might expect of a burglar. The style she describes emphasizes a degree of closure and commitment to finishing a fight quickly rather than the furtive hit-and-run tactics that one commonly associates with the profession."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018276" value="It is clear from the context of this page that the author preferred to work alone, without companions. This perhaps explains her dedication to the art of in-fighting and an emphasis on finishing fights up close and as quickly as possible. She likely had few friends or companions to fall back on in times of danger."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018277" value="This page is difficult to follow as it is covered with sketchy diagrams as well as scrawled text. It seems to be trying to describe some complex movement of the body, but the author was not much of an artist.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, it does hint at some intriguing ideas you would like to try out...."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018278" value="This page does not seem to have much to do with knife fighting.&#10;&#10;The author seems to have wandered into a rambling recollection of one of her more hair-raising exploits, the details of which are both quite bawdy, and rather too dramatic and unlikely to be an entirely honest account...."/>
<label key="key:620759184:118018279" value="A page of painstakingly inked lines and diagrams.

Nevertheless, she was acknowledged as one of the finest knife-fighters in Middle-earth during her time.&#10;&#10;Sadly, The Book of Knives is incomplete; little can be gleaned from its cryptic writings.

<label key="key:620759184:94621395" value="At least two copies of this book are believed to have been lost - one somewhere within Angmar and the other in the Misty Mountains."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018273" value="By the end of the first page it is clear that the author of this book is not Knee-breaker himself, but some considerably more refined lieutenant of his. This unknown author appears to be taking pains to reflect the nature of his employer in his writing, which has resulted in an odd mixture of refined grammar and script that tells the story of a particularly vulgar and unrefined individual."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018274" value="As you read more, there is no question that Knee-breaker was little more than a ruffian and a brigand, selling his services to the highest bidder with little regard to the unsavoury nature of the jobs he undertook.&#10;&#10;The trouble is that he was apparently very, very good at what he did, due to some trick of instinct that guided him unerringly to exploit the weaknesses of those he fought against."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018275" value="This page describes Knee-breaker's band. It cannot really be called anything else -- a band of individuals who followed him almost entirely out of fear, which he encouraged, having little use for real friendship.&#10;&#10;Knee-breaker himself seems to have rarely taken the risk of fighting alone, preferring instead to set up his victims for a thorough beating at the hands of his subordinates. The idea of a fair fight was probably as foreign to him as bathing."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018276" value="As you decipher the script upon this page, it becomes clear that the true purpose of this manual was an effort by the unknown author to translate Knee-breaker's instincts for brutality and cunning into a more intellectual form that could be learned or taught -- and then used to the author's own benefit.&#10;&#10;Surprisingly, this author seems to have made considerable headway in learning the true nature of Knee-breaker's cunning, and the notes contained herein do seem to be hinting towards some important knowledge."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018277" value="This page describes a particular revelation of the writer in his observation of Knee-breaker -- namely the degree to which he relied on sudden and brutal surprise, not just to throw his enemy off-balance, but more importantly to create a crystal-clear moment upon which even the most dull-witted of his underlings could seize to jump upon and overwhelm the enemy before their own cowardice and doubt hamper the assault."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018278" value="According to this passage, Knee-breaker would often as not neglect to even follow up upon his own surprising assaults, preferring to leave most of the battle to his underlings so that he could keep the situation entirely under his supervision and not be drawn into a melee unecessarily.&#10;&#10;This apparently made it even more difficult for one of his untrustworthy followers to turn upon him at a crucial moment and gave him the opportunity to land the showy finishing blow should he feel a need to display his own prowess to his followers."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018279" value="The tone of this page has changed considerably. At this point, the book no longer appears to be relating observations of Knee-breaker's own techniques and exploits, so much as it has become a dissertation of the author's own understanding of the brute's methods.&#10;&#10;The text becomes more difficult to follow as it wanders into more abstract elements of the technique, but it also begins to make it much clearer how one might actually duplicate Knee-breaker's feats without the benefit of his raw brutality and animal cunning."/>
<label key="key:620759198:118018280" value="The last page of the manual appears to be a description of Knee-breaker's untimely demise and a fond farewell passage in his honour.&#10;&#10;The author's underlying tone of irony belies little love lost for his dead master, and though the text does not make it clear, the hints between the lines suggest quite strongly that the author was most likely the main architect of his betrayal and demise, apparently having learned all he cared to from the unfortunate brute."/>

<label key="key:620759209:118018275" value="This page sums up a sequence of letters sent home by Adelbert during the course of his duty in the strife with Golfimbul. To the surprise of all, the lad seemed to have taken to the course of battles and war like a fish to water -- as much as any hobbit could, at any rate. However, he seemed dismissive of the regimentation and orderly nature of the Muster, referring to them as a band of 'useless fops and dandies what hadn't a notion which end of a pike they ought to be on'.&#10;&#10;It seems that he then went about forming his own little band of ruffians and skirmishers from among those hobbits of the more aggressive sort that he could convince to join him -- an act of insubordination that surely would have seen him in irons if they had not quickly proven themselves to be among the most proficient scouts and ambushers in the entire force."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018276" value="This page recounts the experiences of one of Adelbert's fellow hobbits, wherein he goes into the tactics of traps and ambush that they frequently employed against their goblin adversaries, often striking at the break of day as the goblins would be attempting to find shadowy refuge against the painful light of dawn.&#10;&#10;Often they would find the entrance to a cave near a battlefield and wait there concealed, knowing it would be likely that the goblins would attempt to return there as light came back upon the land."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018277" value="This page is particularly interesting as it describes the terrible difficulties the diminutive band of hobbit-skirmishers would face when they came upon particularly deadly foes, such as goblin champions during their battles.&#10;&#10;It seems that Adelbert himself was the foremost among them in finding the weaknesses of such dangerous adversaries, with a keen understanding of the need to expose them so that his fellows could employ their numbers to overwhelm."/>

Of particular note is the degree to which the foes he often faced relied upon intimidation.&#10;&#10;He then describes the advantage he often found that he gained when he was able to deal a painful blow against such an enemy -- even if the injury itself was of little consequence, the opponent often became confused as it seemed that the tables had turned in the favour of its opponent, thus providing the opening Adelbert and his fellows needed to fell the creature."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018279" value="This page describes Adelbert's fighting style as he taught it to his companions during the campaign. It emphasizes a quick and savage assault, often aimed at the strongest leader or beast among the enemy forces in a bid to both eliminate the most dangerous threat and demoralize the enemy at a single stroke.&#10;&#10;The most telling drawback of the method is that the battle will quickly turn against the small assailants if a powerful enemy manages to withstand the attack for more than a few moments, so it entails considerable risk and a readiness to flee swiftly if things do not go their way."/>
<label key="key:620759209:118018280" value="This final page speaks of the Battle of Greenfields wherein Brandobras Took himself struck off the head of Golfimbul in a single blow. It seems that Adelbert was also involved in this battle, fighting some ways distant from his uncle during the fray and aqcuitting himself admirably. Adelbert was sorely injured in the battle and was some months recovering in the comfort of the Shire afterwards.&#10;&#10;Alas, it seems that all the trials faced and lessons learned did surprisingly little to cure the notable character flaws of the miscreant, but he nevertheless became one of Brandobras' favourites in the years that followed and was generally put up with as an errant but likable fellow."/>

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting was written about a rather notorious hobbit-burglar mid Third Age, when the Shire was not so secure as it is today. Having found himself drafted into the Shire-muster during a particularly difficult season and pitted against Golfimbul's goblins in a number of pitched battles, he learned to fight in a most ungentlehobbitly fashion that served him well against foes considerably larger and stronger than himself.&#10;&#10;Alas, it has been many years since its writing, and all copies of this interesting text were thought lost, until now.

<label key="key:620759230:118018273" value="This page heads a basic taxonomy of many of the more common beasts and birds of Middle-earth, offering a short entry describing their names, forms, and where they might be found. The author must be incredibly well-travelled or else has conversed with those who have brought much knowledge from abroad, for the regions he describes extend far beyond the borders of the Kingdoms of the West, into foreign lands with strange and alien names -- and equally odd beasts."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018274" value="This section is dedicated to a discussion of the songs of the smallest of birds and their meanings. The concepts the author describes are not nearly as flighty as one might imagine given the beautiful and transient nature of their songs.&#10;&#10;It would appear that even songbirds must discuss matters of serious import -- at least on occasion."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018275" value="This page describes the diet of bears, which seems to vary considerably from one species to the next. Most it seems would eat the sweet berries and roots to be found in many areas of Middle-earth, while only some will eat meat, and only a few prefer it. He describes the ferocity of bears mainly as a result of their territorial instincts, particularly when mothering cubs and further suggests that this is a power that can be tapped by one who has learned to understand them sufficiently well."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018276" value="This page involves a lengthy discussion of seeds: what plants produce seeds that are edible and which species of animals rely upon them. It offers nothing to help unravel the mystery of why the scribe who copied the original pages might have distorted them so badly."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018277" value="This page again delves into bears...after a fashion.&#10;&#10;It describes a unique tribe of the animals -- unique at first in that they can be called a tribe, which is not common among bears, and secondly because the author proposes that these creatures can in fact take upon themselves the shape of Men should they find the need to do so!&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the author seems prepared to guard the secret of this tribe rather jealously, offering no hints as to where these 'bear-men' might be found."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018278" value="This page discusses the nature of the crebain, a particularly devious form of crow, depending on how you choose to classify them.&#10;&#10;These birds are widely known to have a predeliction for mischief, but the author feels that it goes considerably deeper than that, suggesting that long ago their kind were offered a pact by some dark power in return for an intellect and cunning that extends well beyond that common among animals -- a pact which they accepted and that has bound them through ages since in thrall to that power."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018279" value="This passage seems particularly interesting. Within it, the author discusses spiders at some length. He draws a stark comparison between the common spiders that you might find within your garden or basement, and those breeds that grow to dreadful sizes and display a hateful cunning and hunger.&#10;&#10;While most folk presume that these deadly creatures are simply greater forms of the more common spiders, the mysterious author suggests that these two branches of spider-kind are entirely unrelated. Indeed, he seems to suggest that all of the forms of giant spiders can in fact describe their lineage from a single horrifying monster who existed in long ages past, and that it is from her that their intelligence as well as their grotesque size are descended."/>
<label key="key:620759230:118018280" value="Sitting towards the end of the book, this page delves into the power of a mysterious tribe of bear-men, noting that their power suggests a maleability of form that derives from the nature of the spirit -- even amongst Men. The author surmises that perhaps some nature of those who formed the world is present in some tribes of Men, and that this may be what grants them such powers that others lack? Or perhaps that nature is present in all Men, and only some few have learned the secret of it?&#10;&#10;The author then rambles on a bit and supposes that the most likely answer is that they are really bears after all, and perhaps bears of a particularly foolish sort if they have chosen to take on the forms of Men. How odd."/>

The Book of Beasts speaks at great length of the bonds which may be formed between creatures of the wilds and those among the Free Peoples of Middle-earth who are willing to understand their own true natures. It further claims that the Wise might even learn the tongues of the wild creatures of the world and may coax them to greater feats of bravery and strength than would otherwise be possible for a beast lacking in its own will to strive and accomplish.&#10;&#10;Whomever transcribed this particular copy, alas, does not appear to have been entirely in his right mind. Most of the text is clear, but some few of the pages are written in a hopeless scrawl with no meaning in any language of Elves or Men that you can discern. Indeed, it seems as if the scribe must have been taken with fits of madness during these passages.

<label key="key:620759241:118018273" value="This page begins a list of plants that may be found in the forests of northern Middle-earth, including every sub-species and variety.&#10;&#10;It appears to go on for at least another ten pages -- in very, very small print -- and you are sure you have not even heard of half of them.&#10;&#10;You find yourself wondering how many years it must have taken to compile that list."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018274" value="This page begins a long, rambling dissertation on the shape of leaves. It describes all the varieties of leaf, including colours, shapes, stems, and vein patterns.&#10;&#10;By the end of the tract, you begin to realize that the author has tied them all back together in a most interesting fashion."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018275" value="The author spends a great deal of time discussing the methods by which plants procreate, from seed and nut, to root and creeper. You had not realized before just how many variations there really were.&#10;&#10;There is even a section dedicated to a particular type of tree that only spreads itself after death, as young new trees sprout up along the length of the old tree's fallen, rotting trunk."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018276" value="This section speaks of the proper ways to nourish and tend young plants.&#10;&#10;It reads quite unlike a common book on farming, however, as it is concerned more with the development of wild fields and forests and has little to say about harvesting or sowing in the traditional sense.&#10;&#10;The author does not seem to consider the development of crops as a meaningful pursuit, so much as the creation of a vibrant, living glade or meadow."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018277" value="This section delves into the lore of roots and their interaction with the earth,  discussing their purpose and growth and the effect they have upon rock and soil.&#10;&#10;Most interestingly, it discusses the method by which small hardy bushes and trees cling to harsh, bare rock, slowly breaking it apart year after long year, until in time greater trees and lush undergrowth may take its place amongst the shattered rock and reach into the earth below.&#10;&#10;The process must take centuries -- even the immortal Elves have not the patience to watch such things -- yet the author writes as if he has seen these events first-hand."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018278" value="This section goes on at great length concerning the matter of water and its importance to all living things.&#10;&#10;It notes how many species of tree and plant grow upon the edge of running water and in time come to shape its course to their own needs and purposes, much as a farmer might irrigate a field."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018279" value="This page speaks of the long battles fought amongst plants, as they struggle to live like any other thing.&#10;&#10;The author speaks of these conflicts almost as if they were fought amongst regiments and armies of Men, yet it is clear that these 'wars' are fought out over endless years, and the struggle itself is unguided by any General or King save the forces of nature themselves -- excepting of course when the younger races come wielding axe and fire and upset this order, and events come to move more swiftly.&#10;&#10;Oddly, the author seems to nonchalantly include even the Elves and dwarves amongst the 'younger races' as a matter of course...."/>
<label key="key:620759241:118018280" value="This last section lacks an index of any sort, much as the beginning had no chapters -- as if such an idea simply had not occured to the author, and he expected anyone hefting this massive tome to simply read it through from end to end, even if all they sought was the name of a particular flower.&#10;&#10;As a reference, this book is nearly useless despite its encyclopedic volume, but you are forced to admit that you have never encountered such a vast and comprehensive book concerning the true nature and qualities of plants."/>

The covers are crafted from strips of some fibrous bark supple enough to be woven together, while the pages themselves appear to be birch bark pounded carefully flat and gently inscribed with runic letters in dense rows, page after page. What magic can have allowed such a fragile-looking tome to survive time and age, you cannot guess. Nor have you ever seen a book of such length, for its author goes into each subject and sentence with such painstaking detail that you cannot imagine how long it must have taken to record it all in this fashion. The subject appears to be anything with roots and leaves. There is such an enormous breadth of knowledge concerning root, leaf, bark, and twig that you could likely study it for years without understanding it all.&#10;&#10;To your ire, someone or something has carefully removed a few of the pages from the volume, leaving you to wonder what hidden lore they must have contained.

<label key="key:620759438:118018274" value="This page leads a section of the book describing the early phases of the war, before the Alliance of Elves and Men was fully founded and suspicion was yet rife between the two sides, even as the true threat of Mordor began to reveal itself. This regiment had long been posted in the north to guard the river Anduin as it entered the realm of Gondor -- it is there that the contrivances of the Enemy brought them into unexpected battle with an expedition of Elven warriors come far south out of Lórien."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018275" value="This page describes the contrivance of the Enemy that triggered the ill-fated battle between the forces of Gondor and Lórien. At that time, the forces of Gondor had in their employ men of wild nature whom they paid to bring them news from lands beyond their border, such as the Eastern Marches of Rohan and the Wilderlands.&#10;&#10;They had in part forgotten that they must always be wary of the Enemy's ability to corrupt the hearts of Men, for these untrustworthy scouts brought tidings of a foreign force that had come down the river from the North, armed and armoured in the ways of war and unannounced by any herald -- for those heralds had been slain by dark shadows that crept in the night, unbeknownst to either army."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018276" value="The battle began on a mist-enshrouded morning, as the valiant men of Gondor fell upon the vanguard of the 'invading' host, sowing confusion and panic among the unsuspecting Elves. But the regiment was doubly betrayed, for the quisling servants of the Enemy had lied as well about the size of the Elvish force that had come from the North, and as the main body of their army crested a nearby hill, the Men of Gondor were greatly dismayed, for it was thrice the size they had been told and near equal in number to their own force."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018277" value="Thinking that the worst of fates had come to pass -- that the Elves had somehow thrown in their lot with the forces of the Enemy and so brought the moment of utter defeat and ruin fast upon them -- the Men of Gondor dared not shrink from their foes in the midst of battle, lest all hope of victory be lost in a moment of hesitation.&#10;&#10;Their Captains rallied the men amongst the remnants of the shattered Elf-vanguard and bade them prepare to charge against the Elves, hoping to rout them from the field of battle with the ferocity of their momentum, knowing that prowess and armour would ensure the victory of their immortal foes should the tide of battle turn for even a moment."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018278" value="The page follows a florid description of the great blaze of trumpets and the snapping of banners in the rapidly clearing morning, as the sun rose higher upon the field, and the regiment sprang into thunderous motion up the hill.&#10;&#10;The captain then describes his own puzzlement as he watched the archers of the Elf-host begin their response, hurling their arrows not at them, but up into the sky, the motion of each archer seeming almost lazy and indifferent to the onrushing army, but each one moving with a strict and rapid precision that belied their careless aim."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018279" value="This page describes a bedlam of frightened men and horses as arrows rained down among them, a seemingly endless hail of shafts biting armour, flesh, and ground alike with callous indifference. The captain relates that it was not the deadly accuracy of the arrows that inspired fear and chaos, but their random intensity, such that no man upon the field might feel safe or protected for even a moment whether he carried shield or stood in the shadow of his fellow, and so many faltered and stopped, laying about in vain for cover where there was none to be found.&#10;&#10;The indifferent rain continued until all was chaos and disorder, and few were those valiant souls who made their way to the Elf-host, there to die upon sword and pike wielded with ruthless efficiency."/>
<label key="key:620759438:118018280" value="The captain's last entry describes matters that followed the battle, after the Elves took him and those few others who survived their injuries upon the field captive, and in a short while untangled the deception of the Enemy, for it had been his purpose that the battle should not be so decisive, or that the Men of the West should emerge victorious over the forces of Lórien and so unravel the nascent Alliance -- but the Elves, having come to little harm in the battle, were thus inclined to be lenient and instead directed their anger even more hotly towards Barad-dûr.&#10;&#10;The captain closes by pondering the irony of his regiment's defeat. Had they acquitted themselves with greater valour and cunning upon the field of battle that day...what then would have befallen the Kingdom of Gondor, or indeed all of Middle-earth in the war that followed? Small comfort for so many friends lost, but such are the whims of fate and war."/>

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Furthest Charge was written by a Captain of Gondor who fought in a misguided battle shortly before the War of the Last Alliance. In this battle, the forces of the young kingdom of Gondor found themselves pitted against a company of Elven hunters out of Lórien, both sides having been tricked into battle by a device of the Enemy, who was determined to cripple the alliance that would eventually result in his overthrow. In this book, the Captain describes a valiant but doomed charge of the Men of Gondor against the Elves, within which they suffered a terrible onslaught of arrows raining down from the sky in such fashion as to cause brave men to cower and falter in their advance, trapped unmoving beneath an endless hail of biting wood and metal.&#10;&#10;The Furthest Charge is considered to be a defining work on the power of the hunter's art in the grand battles that have defined the face of Middle-earth today.

<label key="key:620759615:118018273" value="Like many of the songs in Melodies of the Valar, this one is wordless, guiding the voice of the performer as an instrument.&#10;&#10;The song itself seems to conjure in the mind of the listener the image of a babbling brook beneath the foothills of some distant and long-forgotten mountain."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018274" value="The lyrics of the song upon this page are in some strange language even the Elves do not recognize. While in some respects it sounds similar to Sindarin, it is nevertheless alien.&#10;&#10;When listening to the words a sense of unmeasurable ages settles upon you, as if the singer were attempting to describe a time before even the Elves set foot upon the lands of Middle-earth."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018275" value="This song is meant to be sung in a chorus of voices, starting with one and each entering the chorus in turn.&#10;&#10;It is said that when it is performed correctly beneath the light of the stars, the sound rises ever upwards drawing the listeners with it into a rapt contemplation of the vastness of the star-strewn sky."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018276" value="This quiet piece evokes a sense of suspended tension in the air, much as one might feel in the rumbling forerunners of a summer storm flickering upon the horizon.&#10;&#10;How a woman's voice could convey such feelings is unclear, but the effect is unmistakably powerful."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018277" value="This page presents a slow and sonorous melody. It is hard to imagine how a woman's fair voice could have created such a deep tone.&#10;&#10;Its words are mysterious and no known language describes them, but the listener may find themselves transported into an ancient realm beneath the earth, seemingly accompanied  by the tread of heavy boots upon stone and the glimmer of vast caverns formed of lime and crystal, seen as if for the first time by any living eyes. In time, the chant reaches its end and the listener finds himself awakening as if from a deep slumber."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018278" value="This song wells with deep sadness, speaking of honour long fallen to pride and a people lost in dreams of forgotten glory. The music meanders along a bittersweet path that seems to lead inevitably towards the swelling roar of the ocean, along a mythic shore lost beneath the endless waves ages ago."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018279" value="This song is strikingly different from all those that come before. It speaks to the listener of valour, strength, and the achievements of great craft. Clear and certain tones strike a chord deep within any who would lead or who strive to achieve.&#10;&#10;Yet from this lofty beginning it continues without abatement, speaking of the authority of Kings and of the unquenchable pride of one who must master all they attempt. The tones become uncomfortably assertive, assailing the listener, seeming to place a weight upon their shoulders, pushing ever more firmly downwards.&#10;&#10;The final chord reaches a victorious peak as the voice of the singer booms out over the audience with unquestionable authority, demanding submission and adulation from all who listen. It is a powerful, stirring piece, yet some of those who hear it also find it to be profoundly disturbing."/>
<label key="key:620759615:118018280" value="This last piece is most unusual. It is sung in a single voice that conjures forth the image of an infinitely patient crafter building a castle out of tiny pebbles upon the beach, that time and again is dashed away by angry tides. Yet with each passing of the tide the structure grows, becoming ever more grand over ages of quiet labour.&#10;&#10;In the end, the song describes an ancient and beautiful fortress, weathered with the passage of tide and time, inhabited by an elegant, noble people and bearing the banners of a hundred honourable houses upon its walls, standing impregnable upon the edge of an ocean whose tides still crash below -- still violent, but humbled by the crafter's patient art.&#10;&#10;Given that the song offers no words to be understood by mortal (or Elven) ears, it seems odd that such concepts might be conveyed, and yet it does so with remarkable clarity."/>

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;It is said in the most ancient of tales that the world was formed in a great chorus of song, but this story is ancient and shrouded in myth even to the oldest among the living Elves, and no one in Middle-earth today could claim to know the truth of it. Towards the end of the Second Age, during the War of the Last Alliance, there was born a fair woman who sang in such wonderous tones that even the Elves would stop and listen in silence for so long as she would sing for them. Stranger still, she had no teaching in song or music, and yet could compose such melodies as to bring tears to the powerful and the Wise. She claimed that she composed no songs, and that she was simply trying to duplicate a music that she could hear -- a music that she claimed arose from the world itself, from mountains, streams, wind, and tree alike, in infinite variety.&#10;&#10;Melodies of the Valar is the book that contains these songs as the Elves transcribed them, but most of the copies of this book have been taken away into the West, and very few remain in Middle-earth today.

<label key="key:620759628:118018273" value="This page details a classical Dúnedain song from the times when Arnor still stood proudly in the North, extoling the strength and vigour of that lost kingdom.&#10;&#10;Given the rather maudlin praises of the distant past that they seem to prefer in this day and age, the song offers a striking example of how a people's music may change over the passage of years to reflect the condition and times within which they live. It also hints at the strength and heights to which they might again aspire...."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018274" value="Recorded in a particularly ancient form of Sindarin, this song purports to be an Elvish work in praise of the light of Elbereth's stars, written in a timeless age before the Sun and the Moon hung in the sky.&#10;&#10;It is a remarkably simple song, containing few of the more complex contrivances of form that can often be found in Elvish music. Even so, the story of the song's origin sounds more like some tale out of myth than you are ready to give credence to."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018275" value="This spry piece seems to hail from the Shire. It purports to be a local harvest-song from around the Michel Delving area, sung by many of the farmers and youths there as they move through the fields in late summer and fall. The lyrics speak of the fine meals they would enjoy in their comfortable holes during the long, cold winter months that follow."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018276" value="This song was written by a talented singer amongst the Rohirrim and speaks simply and clearly of the love he held for a young woman among his own people.&#10;&#10;Unlike so many love-songs, it does not dwell on the sorrow of parting, nor unrequitted love, nor jealousy, nor hardship of any sort. It speaks solely of her beauty in his eyes, and the joy that comes to those lovers who learn to truly understand each other."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018277" value="Technically speaking, this song is a dwarf-dirge sung for the fallen upon the field of battle, though it is not clear which of the dwarf-houses it hails from.&#10;&#10;The song's relationship to a dirge is distant at best, as it turns the sombre tones of the form on their head with the inclusion of bawdy, irreverent lyrics intended to unreservedly celebrate both the life and death of the fallen hero. Indeed, you have never seen so brash and overt a challenge to the sullen and infinite power of death as this song proposes."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018278" value="This song is a victory march from Gondor, written to celebrate the grand victory of the Last Alliance over the forces of darkness and the fall of Sauron. It was written before Isildur's untimely death, and in the context of the events that followed, it has gained an undertone of sombre irony.&#10;&#10;Regardless, it also clearly declares the strength and power of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth to rise up against seemingly unconquerable adversity."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018279" value="Though sometimes it seems that the immortal span of the Elves results in a preponderance of art that breathtakingly mourns times and places lost beyond the memory of any mortal race, there are also those that speak of the vitality of the endless present, describing the experience of those Elves who do not care to dwell on the events of ages past.&#10;&#10;This song is one of the latter, rooted firmly in the experience of living in a vital world that obligingly continues to change, offering an unlimited palette of new experiences to anyone who cares to open their eyes to the world that surrounds them in the here and now."/>
<label key="key:620759628:118018280" value="This song speaks only to the wonder and palette of the natural world, without acknowledgement of axe, nor fire, but only the passage of seasons, the growth of trees, and the wandering of animals who guard no purpose beyond the day at hand.&#10;&#10;At first, you suppose that it might be an Elvish song, but on further reflection the forms do not reflect that heritage of music. In fact, you find it difficult to determine who might have written such a piece, for it does not adhere to the principles common to any of the Free Peoples -- and it is certainly no work of Orc or Dragon -- but the mystery only adds to its cachet as a unique and vibrant work of art."/>

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Rising Chord is considered to be a remarkable collection of songs all of a theme that speaks to the heart of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in one voice, be they Men, Elves, or dwarves. Drawing on the tradition of each of these peoples, the songs resound with a clarion call of freedom and hope that is unsullied by the slightest trace of sorrow, fear, or hate. There are some who claim that this work is shallow and without dimension, but to the adept minstrel, it is a description of form unparalleled by other works. Unfortunately, the book and its strident forms became 'unfashionable' after the fall of the North Kingdom, as a deep lethargy and cynicism crept over the kingdoms of Men, and the Elves withdrew ever further into their forest strongholds.&#10;&#10;'Nowadays, The Rising Chord is quite difficult to find, and even when a copy is found -- such as this -- it is incomplete at best. Perhaps the famed Elvish minstrel Lindir might be able to tell you more about it."/>

<label key="key:620759641:118018273" value="The first song is an old Númenórean rower's song meant to lift the spirits of soldiers bent hard at the oar and to prevent fatigue before impending battle at sea. It called upon the winds to offer speed, the morning mists to confound their enemies, and the waves to hurl them ashore lest they founder in the deeps."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018274" value="This ancient music was a ceremonial march played for soldiers who had returned from across the sea, to celebrate their safe homecoming after duties far from the shores of the Isle of Númenor."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018275" value="This stirring but mournful march was supposedly played to commemorate the deaths of lesser nobles and dignitaries of the ancient kingdom of Númenor."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018276" value="This unique piece was supposedly played in the royal court of Númenor to unmistakably announce the victory of the King whenever a conquered leader was brought before his throne. It was played in that court for the last time when the Enemy was brought before the King in chains, having surrendered before the might of Númenor's armies.&#10;&#10;After the fall of Númenor it came to be said that to play this march was to invite disaster and defeat in any military endeavour."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018277" value="This drum-dominated score is a truly classical example of a military march. Played by the soldiers of Númenor as they marched victoriously across the ancient lands of Middle-earth, it was one of the most recognizable pieces of music in its day.&#10;&#10;Many variataions of this score exist today, but the original was thought lost in the long turmoil following the sudden fall of that mighty kingdom."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018278" value="This drum score is considered very unusual for the period of the Númenóreans. Minstrels and scholars suppose that its writer may have been influenced by contact with the musical culture of the Haradrim, far off in the uncharted South of Middle-earth.&#10;&#10;Such was the scope and power of Númenor at its height that even those distant kingdoms knew war and trade with the Men of Westernesse."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018279" value="Though penned by a minstrel of Númenor, this song is written in Sindarin and shows numerous influences from the Elven culture of music.&#10;&#10;This piece likely arose during the earlier span of Númenor's long reign before the Men of Westernesse mostly turned away from their appreciation of things Elvish, and a deep estrangement formed between the their peoples."/>
<label key="key:620759641:118018280" value="This song was an anthem written to celebrate the unlimited might and majesty of the Last King of Númenor as he embarked at the head of a vast expeditionary fleet. It speaks of a vast fleet numbering in the thousands and of the ascension of the King to godhood as he proudly sailed into the West.&#10;&#10;The song ends half-finished -- clearly the minstrel had left it incomplete in expectation of describing the victorious return of the fleet with its god-king, but never got the chance to do so."/>

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Valour's Marches -- the very title of the book you hold stirs something within your breast as you look upon it. Though its cover crumbles with age, the binding remains strong, as if infused with the same martial fervour that the melodies within it strive to invoke. This book is one of the rare few that survived the fall of the kingdom of Númenor, coming across the waves by some unlikely circumstance to Middle-earth, where it has lain hidden for ages. Though written in the Sindarin tongue, the songs are those of the noble kingdoms of Men. Nevertheless, they speak to the heart of any who would face battle, calling forth visions of endless, shining hosts on the march, thundering with the clash of steel in a thousand voices.&#10;&#10;In the hands of a minstrel, these songs of martial eminence provide crucial insight into the working of the warrior's heart and how it might be aroused from its slumber in times of need. If only so many of the songs were not frustratingly missing from the volume you now hold. Perhaps Lindir of Rivendell may be able to help fill the voids."/>

<label key="key:620759777:118018273" value="This page includes a scholarly discussion of the gravity of oaths and debates the merits of granting them to personages of differing relationships and ranks.&#10;&#10;It particularly stresses the danger inherent in a personage of high station granting an oath to someone of lesser station, for it ties not only the oathgiver by their word, but all of their vassals and subjects as well to the fate of the one to whom that oath is granted -- for good or for ill."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018274" value="This section of the book includes a spirited argument between philosophers over the nature of Oaths and the Fate of those who become bound up in them.&#10;&#10;On one side of the matter are those who argue that the words and intent of the Oathgiver serve to shape fate itself, tying them irrevokeably together in a bond that may guide the actions of those who are part of it in their endeavours -- and similarly hanging as a sword over the Oathgiver, promising a dread fate should that bond be violated.&#10;&#10;The other side of the debate includes scholars who reject the notion that mere words shape the world, claiming instead that it is the actions of the Oathgiver that decide the outcome of fate. They argue that the Oath itself simply acts to focus the will or prove the lie of the one who takes it, and that the shame of failure, corruption of the spirit, and the disillusionment of their peers serve more than adequately to turn the tides of fate against the oathbreaker without need of divine providence to mete out punishment."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018275" value="This page leads into a discussion at considerable depth of the fate of an ancient Elf who was a Lord among Lords, who set upon himself and his people an Oath so powerful and dire that it is believed to have shaped the course of entire ages of the world, and the fate of countless Elves, Men, and dwarves.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the argument remains quite abstract within these pages, as the scholars of Men who penned the work seem only to know of these events through legends and myths, and the Elves of that time were apparently not keen to discuss the subject openly.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, if the events described by the scholars are indeed founded even partially in truth, it suggests that the Oath taken by this Elf-lord may well have been the most powerful words ever to pass the lips of any being of Middle-earth, be they mortal or immortal, wizard or king."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018276" value="This page wanders into a highly esoteric discussion concerning Oaths and Dragons.&#10;&#10;True Dragons are renowned for their power to subtly twist words to their own ends and befuddle the minds of those who are foolish enough to treat with them. The writer attempts to determine whether a creature such as a Dragon could ever truly be bound by an Oath, however granted, or whether they could indeed be bound as such, but would instead use their mastery of lies and deceit to craft an Oath such that the one to whom they granted it would find themselves bound instead.&#10;&#10;The arguments, while interesting, eventually become circular and insubstantial as it becomes clear that the writer had little experience in the subject of speaking with Dragons, yet was wise enough not to seek out experimental evidence with which to support his work...."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018277" value="This page discusses the care with which even the lightest of Oaths must be given. It states that while all Oaths bind, the strength of that bond and the fate that follows may have little to do with the gravity of the words spoken, and a great deal to do with the unforeseen events that then follow.&#10;&#10;In particular, the scholar points out the story of a simple and friendly Oath offered at the birthday of a minor noble of the houses of Númenor -- an Oath that in the course of time and events drew his house into a years-long war which served to destroy the fortunes of his family and saw him die a lonely pauper.&#10;&#10;Alas, it is impossible to say if the tale was a true one, or a cautionary fable devised by the author to strengthen his argument."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018278" value="Many tales speak of the dire consequence of an Oath foolishly given or broken. This page offers a discussion of the strength that may be gained through such bonds when they are wisely taken and followed.&#10;&#10;It speaks of a terribly old legend that describes a Man and an Elf-maiden bound in an Oath of love that was so true and so powerful that though in time they found themselves trapped beneath the gaze of the greatest Enemy of that or any other Age, they nonetheless found the means to escape that Evil and flee back into the light of the Sun, stealing away his greatest treasure with them."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018279" value="This page describes in detail the Oath of the King of Númenor, taken upon his ascendancy to office. The section goes on into enormous detail concerning how the Oath changed over the course of long dynasties and all the various legal and ceremonial ramifications of those changes.&#10;&#10;Despite the wealth of historical knowledge, you find that after reading a few of the minutely printed paragraphs your head begins to ache with the convoluted wording and excessively complex detail, and you fear that you might either nod off, be driven mad, or both should you continue."/>
<label key="key:620759777:118018280" value="This page stands out from among the rest. The ink it is written in is a strange, messy scrawl, and it delves into a disturbing subject indeed, quite different from the rest of the book.&#10;&#10;The writer of this particular section seems obsessed with those spirits which remain in the world of the living long after the time of their own death, and the possible cause of this strange and disturbing undeath.&#10;&#10;In some cases at least, such spirits are known to have claimed some unresolved or broken Oath as the bond that holds them in this world beyond their time, and the writer delves into the subject with unbridled curiosity, pondering on what power might make the bond of a man's Oath so strong as to keep it in the world long beyond its time.&#10;&#10;Further passages become more disturbing yet, as it becomes clear that the writer's fascination with the subject has become unhealthy, as he ponders how servants and slaves might perhaps be made to take Oaths that would bind them in service to their Lords after death.&#10;&#10;If the author of this piece ever discovered such a secret, you find with some relief that it is not recorded here."/>

Much of the power to guide men truly derives from the simple bond of Truth itself, and for those who lead, an Oath is a bond of commitment that cannot be broken without inviting a fate most dire. Indeed, a captain who would betray his own word risks more than his life, for it is well-known that an Oath fatefully taken binds far more than the flesh.&#10;&#10;This book is said to be the utmost authority in such matters, but the copy you have found seems badly damaged and many important passages are missing.

Among the tales of the great battle are some accounts of the author's own courageous deeds."/>
<label key="key:620764889:118018274" value="This page tells of the author's encounter with the chief of the goblin invaders. Though the battle had raged for many hours and his strength was flagging, he was able to muster his strength in the defence of his fellows."/>

It is no simple treatise on the art of battle, as so many texts are. Rather, it is a philosophical tract that describes the author's outlook upon warfare and battle, and how he came eventually to seek it out as a meditative and even transcendant experience that he was unable to experience in any other setting save the midst of clashing blades and the cries of battle. It is not a text for the faint-hearted or the meek, but it seems oddly lofty and its tone does not reflect the maddened bloodlust that one might have expected given the title.&#10;&#10;Alas, the long years have been rough on your copy, and there are a number of pages torn or missing from it.

<label key="key:620764901:118018273" value="The early sections of this book seem to focus on the importance of basic drills -- similar to many another warrior's guide, but the author goes into some depth on the purpose of these mindless activities and suggests some novel meditative techniques to be used before and after the drills to improve their efficacy."/>
<label key="key:620764901:118018274" value="This page proves to be more of a text on the healing arts, than on fighting. The author cautions that the strain of such rigourous drills may injure a warrior ere he ever reaches the field of battle and suggests a particular regimen of herbal compresses and heated cloths to help the muscles and joints heal more quickly after the grueling exercises."/>
<label key="key:620764901:118018275" value="Never have you seen such attention to detail in a warrior's treatise.&#10;&#10;The author has gone so far as the measure of strength with which a blow must land to rend an enemy's armour, be it leather, chain, or tempered dwarf-steel. He then goes into how one may train himself to gauge the strength of his own blows to ensure that the blow lands truly each time, with no waste of strength or motion."/>
<label key="key:620764901:118018276" value="This page is covered with diagrams of the arm, displaying numerous positions of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, as well as their ranges of motion.&#10;&#10;It seems to be an exploration of the possible forms in which a weapon might be swung to its best effect."/>
<label key="key:620764901:118018277" value="This page lists a series of weights that may be attached to one's blade or mace to gradually increase its weight and further strengthen the arm during practice drills. The author suggests a slow but unwaveringly steady series of increases, up to the point where the weights seem impractical for anyone who is not a troll to manage.&#10;&#10;You find yourself wondering a bit about the sincerity of the author, but so much of the book is gruelingly logical and methodical that you imagine he must really be serious. How many of his students actually survived this regimen may be a more pertinent question."/>
<label key="key:620764901:118018278" value="This page is used to describe the training area that the author constructed for himself. It seems large and unsurprisingly spartan, focusing only on those necessities of the art of combat, foregoing virtually all other comforts or distractions.&#10;&#10;You doubt that this fellow got around to many festivals or had a lot of friends."/>
<label key="key:620764901:118018279" value="This page is the first to discuss technique beyond the most basic of motions. It discusses the momentum of the weapon, stating that the student -- who presumably has dutifully followed all that came before -- must now learn how to retain the speed and power of his strikes, whether they strike wood, metal, flesh, or air as the opponent moves and blocks in turn.&#10;&#10;The warrior that is capable of keeping his weapon in motion throughout all these moments of battle will tire more slowly and retain the advantage as he forces his opponent to react again and again, rather than acting in turn."/>
<label key="key:620764901:118018280" value="The author provides a summary of the training and drills offered throughout the book, tying them all together in the same clear and spartan fashion as all that came before.&#10;&#10;You find yourself believing that even a child could learn to fight masterfully following these methods -- assuming that said child had some troll's blood in his veins and a fanatical devotion to swordsmanship that most would consider unhealthily obsessive...."/>

The text is so ancient that some of the pages threaten to crumble in your hands as you carefully peruse it. While the dialect is ancient and difficult to read, the author's approach to swordsmanship is rather unusual, placing a great deal of emphasis on grueling repetition and concentration around what appear to be the most basic motions of the form. It suggests a focus on absolute control and power, which then leads to the discovery of finesse and artistry.&#10;&#10;If only several key passages and pages were not missing, it could be an invaluable training guide -- perhaps Gimli the Dwarf could tell you more?"/>

At that time, Durin's Folk were scattered and greatly reduced in number, and the Guardian's role took on a much greater importance as the threat of goblins and Orcs to dwarf-settlements beneath the roots of the world became more and more common.

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;A Shield-maiden's Song was written many long years ago and tells the tale of a Shield-maiden of Rohan. While the Shield-maidens of Rohan were rarely called to war, they were nevertheless as well-trained and versed in the arts of battle as their male counterparts. This book tells the tale of one such Maiden caught in unexpected battle, who in striving to defend her Lord against a great onslaught, sang out in clearest tones a stirring song of war as she fought. Such was the power of her voice that even the Orcs whom she faced saw her not as a frail woman, but as a great warrior to be feared.&#10;&#10;Alas, you have no idea how the story ends and several other details beside seem to be missing from this copy of the book, which has been damaged by time and neglect. Perhaps there is someone at Rivendell who would be able to make use of it."/>

<label key="key:620765229:118018273" value="Like several others, this section is written mainly in Elven prose of an ancient form, making it devilishly difficult to comprehend. You manage to make out several passages that refer to the Oaths of service or fealty that the Elf-guardians of old would make to their charges and lords before embarking into danger.&#10;&#10;It seems that they believed such Oaths formed an important foundation for their strength in battle, and they would never enter into them lightly."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018274" value="Another page of nearly indecipherable and ancient prose, it describes battle between two enemies as something other than a simple melee.&#10;&#10;Instead, the text describes battles between powerful foes as a form of ritual or dance (your translation here is uncertain) -- one that forms the basis for a bond between the two combatants that transcends the physical.&#10;&#10;You begin to suspect that the author was of a decidedly mystical outlook."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018275" value="Sticking to indecipherable prose, the author speaks of the greater tide of battle, wherein many foes stand across from each other hurling insult and threat before inevitably breaking upon each other. This aspect, too, he considers the foundation of a greater bond, both between the fellow warriors of each army, and between the two forces themselves as they steel themselves for battle.&#10;&#10;You remain unclear on the nature of this bond the author keeps referring to, but it is clearly the central theme of the work."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018276" value="This page is one of the few written in plain language, though the ancient tongue makes it difficult nevertheless.&#10;&#10;It speaks of more mundane subjects than some of the others, such as the crucial role of the guardian in maintaining control over the pace of battle, never allowing it to run away from them and become that portrait of meaningless chaos and noise that presages defeat."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018277" value="Another of the few pages that forego prose for plain language, this speaks to the strength of the guardian's defence, and the manner in which it permits them to find their way to the pulsing heart of the battle, a vantage from which one may express the greatest degree of control over the ebb and flow of the enemy's motion and morale."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018278" value="This page is written in prose so flowery and intricate that after the toils of translating the ancient text you are left with no idea what point the author was trying to make.&#10;&#10;Hopefully it is not crucial to the book's secrets or the author would have spoken more plainly?"/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018279" value="This poem describes that moment in which a great warrior finds himself standing at the heart of the maelstrom -- that place in time and space where the course of the battle almost seems to be suspended like a great thunderhead, moments before the storm breaks. A sense of dread fate falls upon the warrior's shoulders, knowing that the next decision made will resonate with the fate of the world and describe much that is to come."/>
<label key="key:620765229:118018280" value="The final page tells of a word -- or perhaps a will made manifest by the heart of the warrior as they stand among their foes and allies alike. Both Oath and Challenge, the form of the word itself is second to its purpose and moment, which the warrior may use to bind all those who face him to his own fate irrevocably.&#10;&#10;The author's point is clear. You find yourself wondering whether he purposes to say that there is truly a spiritual force to this word, or whether it is simply a call to the burning hatred of your enemies that in such a time and place they cannot refuse it."/>

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;This book is of Elvish origin, having been written so long ago that few of the Elves today were alive at the time of its writing. You cannot even guess at how old it actually is, as it seems to show few signs of age or decay. You cannot recognize the type of parchment it was written upon, nor what kind of ink could withstand the passage of so much time without fading. The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break.&#10;&#10;It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safe-guard its secrets in an age long past.

<label key="key:620767446:118018275" value="In this chapter, our heroine finds herself trapped in a cave crawling with giant spiders of a decidedly evil and hungry sort. Witty banter and deception are swiftly discarded in this plight, as the valiant young girl resorts to tricks and conjurations of flame and the edge of her blade to slash and burn her way to freedom, barely dodging poisoned mandibles and lassoes of web a dozen times as she escapes from the horrid cave."/>
<label key="key:620767446:118018276" value="This chapter finds our heroine challenged by the border guards of Gondor as she continues her travels.

<label key="key:620767446:118018277" value="This chapter describes the heroine's journey with her self-appointed guardian through the realm of Gondor.

<label key="key:620767446:118018278" value="This page includes a particularly tense and thrilling sequence where the young Lore-master and her companion are ambushed by a vicious band of goblins.&#10;&#10;Poisoned by their darts and barely able to fight, the captain is rescued by his own charge as she puts his training in the blade to good use against their attackers."/>

<label key="key:620767446:54354734" value="The first four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Angmar, Eregion, and Moria. The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Lore of the Blade seems to be a rather unusual tome for a Lore-master to express interest in. Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair.

Bree-town itself was built upon a cross-roads between Arthedain and its sister kingdom Cardolan to the east. Once they were all one great kingdom, stretching all across the north, but the folly of Men first sundered them, then set them against each other until one after another they fell over the long years of the Third Age.&#10;&#10;There are some folk who still remember the tales of Arthedain, but you suspect that the crest may be of particular importance to the Rangers, for it is said that they are descended from that bloodline."/>

None could approach without her knowledge, and those with evil intent would feel her gaze upon them and flee.&#10;&#10;She passed into the Old Forest many long years ago and became part of the forest, granting her keen senses to the trees and creatures herein that evil might not approach unseen, for those were dark days and few places remained that were untouched by the power of Sauron.&#10;&#10;The flowers are said to mark the place where she disappeared into the forest and seem to have been tended by someone."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018274" value="You have discovered the flower of Neldorlas, an Entwife of old.

Such was her understanding of the arts of cultivation and teaching.&#10;&#10;As with her sisters, she chose to become a part of the Old Forest, that it might endure the encroachment of darkness and evil throughout the years. So the folk tales say, anyway."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018275" value="The flower you found marks the place where the Entwife Dorollin passed into the Old Forest, perhaps forever.&#10;&#10;She was among the largest of her kind, taller than any other, for the essence of all that grows was at the core of her nature. Her gardens were sprawling places wrapped in great vines, and enormous trees cast their shade upon acres of fertile ground.&#10;&#10;She gave herself to the Old Forest to ensure that it would grow great enough to protect itself from the incursion of evil such as Orcs and thoughtless Men.&#10;&#10;Some folk say that one day they will awaken and emerge from the forest - but no one knows when that might be."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018276" value="You discovered Cordofoneth's flower -- said to be one of eight Entwife sisters. Among her kin, she held most dear her affection for all living things.&#10;&#10;It was this affection that she lent the Old Forest when she passed into its depths long ago, that all manner of living things might find shelter within its bounds. The flower you have found marks the place where she entered the forest, and she has not been seen since.&#10;&#10;Alas, the Old Forest has oft been harmed by Men or intruded upon by darker powers, and so it is said that her heart lies muted, and she sleeps more deeply than her sisters. Perhaps she is awaiting the day when this world might become a place of lighter moods and the love of life is not so easily betrayed by axe or fire."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018277" value="You have discoverd the flower of Lenhwest. She was believed to be an Entwife known for her unquenchable passions. She could love as no other, but fury and despair were also her constant companions.&#10;&#10;Amongst her sisters, she was the first to give herself to the forest, swept by her own emotions to ensure its survival during the trials of those dark years. Her presence is strongly felt in these woods still.&#10;&#10;It is for fear of Lenhwest's tempestuous anger that folk walk with care in the Old Forest, for many believe that if her heart turns against you, it is unlikely you will ever emerge from it again!"/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018278" value="You have found Silloth's flower. She was said to have been a wonderous spirit - her heart was unbowed even during the ancient war that drove the Entwife sisters here, for mirth and frivolity ever followed in her wake, and her gardens were believed to be places where even the weariest of mortals could bring themselves to smile and laugh.&#10;&#10;Among the Elves she was particularly beloved, and of those who remember her they fear they may never again hear the sound of her laughter beneath the boughs of ancient trees."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018279" value="The flower of Braiglad is seen as a warning by superstitious folk who would dare the depths of the Old Forest. She was an Entwife unusual amongst her sisters, for she was a wild and capricious being. Her gardens were populated by untamed beasts, and even the most delicate flowers within them were adorned with sharp thorns.&#10;&#10;Braiglad rarely spoke with mortals, preferring the wild places of the forest, and in time she gave herself to the forest to protect it from the dark powers.&#10;&#10;There are those who say her spirit is strongest when aroused by wild and dangerous times such as these."/>
<label key="key:620774284:118018280" value="The tale of Merillif's flower often brings tears to those who hear it. Of the eight Entwives who came to the Old Forest, she was the most beautiful and the most beloved of all.&#10;&#10;Her gardens shone with a brilliance of colour that even the finest artisans of the Firstborn would regard with envy. Her jewels were said to be the petals of flowers, and while they would last but a short season -- unlike the gems of the Noldor which are forever -- their beauty far surpassed that of any object carved of stone or crystal. This passing beauty was such that it endured no greed, and so the vanity of evil hearts could neither possess nor endure it.&#10;&#10;Those who are fond of the story say that she will awaken some day when beauty can again be shared amongst all the creatures of Arda without fear of despoilment or jealous vanity."/>

<label key="key:620775339:54354734" value="Goblins are an odd study in group-thought. As individuals, they are snivelling cowards who recoil from anyone who appears remotely stronger than themselves -- in large masses, they are known to hurl themselves with unthinking savagery onto pike and axe. The common wisdom is that in large groups the goblins in front simply have no choice, as they are pushed forward by the teeming masses behind them, and so they fight like cornered animals. From what you have seen, there may be some truth to this."/>

<label key="key:620775348:118018273" value="Fighting a creature strong enough to crush stone in its hands poses a particular challenge. Namely, you do not want it to get those hands on you -- a tall order considering how long their arms are.&#10;&#10;Dwarf-regiments are trained to pick approaching trolls out of the teeming masses of goblins or Orcs who drive them. They strike them with bolts and missiles to goad them into a frenzied charge, hoping to impale the creatures on massed pikes and spears before the stalwart defenders become embroiled in mass combat."/>

<label key="key:620797387:118018274" value="This small cave in the rocks of the High Pass offers apparent shelter for travellers in times of storm, but it was long ago discovered to be a concealed entrance into the burrows of Goblin-town below, from which goblins would emerge in the dark of night to kidnap those foolish enough to make camp here.&#10;&#10;These days the crack sees little use as few even attempt the crossing any more, and the goblins more frequently emerge through the larger gate down below as they make ominous preparations for war."/>
<label key="key:620797387:118018275" value="Dómstoll -- more often called the Giant's Throne in Westron -- is a great seat of massive stones that sits above the abandoned ruins of Starkhath and offers a domineering view of the surrounding region when it is not obscured by driving snow and mist.&#10;&#10;Most of the giants left this place long ago, but rumours say that one, at least, still remains to watch over this lonely domain."/>
<label key="key:620797387:118018276" value="The Erforgh Cleft is a massive jumble of rocks and frozen streams left behind by some great mass of ice in ages past. Now it offers some semblance of shelter from the most brutal mountain winds to a nomadic tribe of Gauredain who have made their home here.&#10;&#10;Whether the Gauredain came here of their own accord or were directed here by the Enemy is uncertain, but their presence is troubling nonetheless."/>
<label key="key:620797387:118018277" value="This complex of caves called the Writhenbores seems to be formed by a great mass of boulders, larger than even the giants could hope to lift. How they came to be this way is a mystery -- perhaps by the fall of an entire peak upon the mountainside below or some equally cataclysmic event.&#10;&#10;The caves are oddly warmer than the wind-stripped slopes outside, possibly heated by a warm spring welling up from deep below the mountain. However, any traveller hoping to take shelter within would be strongly advised to look elsewhere, for this same warmth has drawn a large and deadly brood of worms into these caves, and to carelessly wander within is certain death."/>
<label key="key:620797387:118018278" value="A group of travellers who passed this way many years ago described a place where giants capriciously tossed boulders across the pass for sport and amusement.&#10;&#10;The giants appear to be gone now -- some say they were driven away when a new Great Goblin took the throne of Goblin-town and relations between the two races became intolerable. In time, tired of being tormented by their diminutive foes, the giants left this place and moved towards Iorbar to the south-west.&#10;&#10;Only the massive stone slabs that they once used as shelter remain, echoing with the howls of the Wargs who now prowl among them."/>
<label key="key:620797387:118018279" value="Founded before the city of Helegrod, Hrimbarg was once called 'The Crown of the Misty Mountains' by the dwarves who lived there, and they marked it as the highest dwelling of their people in all the world at that time.&#10;&#10;Alas, it fell neither to goblins nor giants nor dragons or other wickedness -- but tales say it fell to a great storm that drove down upon the High Pass and did not relent for five long years, choking the passes with vast mountains of ice, even burying Hrimbarg itself beneath a deep, featureless blanket of snow.&#10;&#10;When at last the storm relented and their fellows from Moria came north to relieve their brothers at Hrimbarg, not one dwarf was found alive, all having frozen or starved during the long years of isolation. It was decided thereafter that Hrimbarg should not be resettled, and it has stood empty for years beyond reckoning."/>

It has much to say of the early days of the Rangers, when they were at their most scattered after the fall of Arnor. It was lost, however, when Arador was slain by trolls in the wilds of the Ettenmoors. It is thought that he buried it before the battle that ended in his death, but none knew where. A new annal was kept beginning with his son, Arathorn II, but all the wisdom of the preceding chieftains vanished, presumably forever."/>

Haldemar, returning from a journey, was able to cleverly lure them off with his diversionary tactics upon his return home."/>

After the Battle of Greenfields, Haldemar became a Warden of the Shire, and told many Tall (or rather short) Tales of adventures beyond the Bounds, many of them humorous accounts of battle against goblins and trolls and other beasts, some wholly imagined. Though much of the book is whimsy, there is truth at the core that any Warden would value. Sadly, the three known copies of the book were all stolen, suspiciously, within a week of one another nearly a century ago."/>

<label key="key:620833502:118018275" value="The Twenty-first hall is among the largest in all of Khazad-dûm, and often regarded as the most famous. In times long past a great market stood here where the Dwarves of Moria and travellers from abroad would trade in fine goods from across much of Middle-earth. Fine woods and wine and foodstuffs would be exchanged for gold and priceless gems and finely wrought pieces of smith-craft. In truth nearly anything at all could be bought or sold within this very hall, though it is hard to imagine it to look upon it now."/>

<label key="key:620860290:118018274" value="You travelled the wilderness of Eriador, bringing word to the Dúnedain: it is time to fulfil their oath of loyalty to Aragorn son of Arathorn."/>
<label key="key:620860290:118018275" value="You rode south with the Rangers of the Grey Company, through Eregion and into Enedwaith, where you encountered a mysterious dwarf who has unexpected knowledge about the road ahead."/>

<label key="key:620860290:118018277" value="You have escaped from the clutches of Saruman and rescued the surviving members of the Grey Company from the prison-caves of the Falcon Clan, but the future of your quest remains uncertain.

<label key="key:620860290:118018280" value="You tracked the Fellowship of the Ring south along Anduin to Parth Galen and the Falls of Rauros, where you encountered signs that they were set upon by foes. Two hobbits, most likely Frodo Baggins and his servant Samwise Gamgee, crossed the river and continued on their quest. The surviving members of the company crossed into Rohan, and if you are to find them and help them, you will need war-steeds of your own."/>
<label key="key:620860290:118018281" value="You have journeyed into the Riddermark, helping the people of East Rohan and tracking the remnants of the Fellowship of the Ring. Your travels brought you through the Wold, the Norcrofts, and finally the Entwash Vale, where Nona vanished and Horn realized his feelings for her."/>
<label key="key:620860290:218639268" value="You journeyed throughout West Rohan, aiding its people as they prepare to face the perils of war."/>
<label key="key:620860290:218639270" value="You stood with the Rohirrim at the fortress of the Hornburg, in Helm's Deep, and survived the long night of battle with Saruman's armies. When dawn came, impossibly, Théoden and his people looked out over the Deep in victory."/>

<label key="key:620862215:9244193" value="This chamber within Delotham is centrally-located, but must see very little in the way of explorers. Bats nest here in the dark corners, and treasure too can be found if the shadowy curtain is drawn aside."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244194" value="This corner in the western area of Delotham is partially collapsed, as the ravages of time buckled the south wall. As the Orcs spread throughout Minas Elendúr and Delotham in search of survivors of the initial assault, Elves came to hide wherever they could stay ahead of the marching footfall of the Orcs. This corner may once have sheltered such an Elf, though what became of any who tried to stay here is unknown and unknowable."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244195" value="This sunken chamber, hidden for some days following the initial assault of the Orcs, is where the last three Elves of Minas Elendúr made their stand against the Enemy, when war came to Eregion. No tales tell how long they may have held out against the overwhelming force of the Orcs, but it is the tradition of Elrond of Rivendell to say that they held out until the end -- and beyond it -- and only when those who had escaped were safely out of Eregion did these last three fall."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244196" value="The northernmost room of Delotham was built a distance from the other rooms, but none can say for what purpose it may have been. It seems to have not been for defensive reasons, for time alone is responsible for the decay in this chamber, and the war that came to Eregion and destroyed the Elves of Minas Elendúr seems to have left this chamber alone."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244208" value="From this windowed chamber, the Elves that lived in this place watched as the forces of evil marauded through Minas Elendúr, slaying its meagre defenders. This elevated chamber bears the mark of their grief and despair, waiting as they did for the end to come."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244209" value="After the first assault of Orcs attacked Minas Elendúr, many of the Elves that remained within were scattered and had to fend for themselves. They made their way through the maze-like interior, avoiding patrolling Orcs wherever they could. Rooms such as this one enabled many of the Elves to escape from their pursuers, but not all were successful."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244210" value="This room has been marked by terrible evil, and the very stones cry out against the stain. What can have happened in this place to leave such torment in its wake?"/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244211" value="Three passages lead away from the northernmost room in Minas Elendúr, passages down which the heavy tramp of Orc-feet carried even on the still air when war came to Eregion."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244212" value="This upper balcony overlooks a courtyard in the southern area of Minas Elendúr and is home to treasure forgotten -- or ignored -- by the Orcs."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244213" value="Part of the wall has crumbled away in this south-west corner of Delotham, the basement of Minas Elendúr. It is patrolled now by Ninkoth uruks, their heavy footfalls bringing to mind that of the Orcs that stalked these passages when war came to Eregion."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244214" value="Stone-lizards scamper along the floor of this chamber in Delotham, perhaps drawn by the illumination that breaks through the ceiling from above."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244215" value="Treasure can be found among the fallen rocks and debris of this junction in Delotham, where long ago Elves fought to defend their home from attack by the forces of evil."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244216" value="This chamber, accessible only by stairs from Minas Elendúr, served as a final hiding-place for the Elves here when the Orcs came for them. The Enemy has more than just Orcs in his service, and this chamber still bears the mark of the evil that happened between these buried walls."/>
<label key="key:620862215:9244217" value="A diverse range of creatures make their home now in Delotham: stone-lizards and insects that have come to this place from hidden cracks within Khazad-dûm. The four passages that meet here ensure that it once saw much foot traffic in time of peace and much hurried panic in time of war."/>

<label key="key:620949045:8567441" value="You crossed through the expanse of Central Gondor and came to the port city of Pelargir, where you faced Balakhôr the Scourge and ended the threat of Umbar."/>
<label key="key:620949045:8567444" value="Following the defeat of the Corsairs at Pelargir, Aragorn entrusted you with the mission of keeping secret his capture of their ships and his plan to sail up the Anduin to the aid of Minas Tirith. You went by another road to Osgiliath, now held by the enemy, and sabotaged the great war machine Grond. It was there that you encountered a foe you thought had been dispatched: Mordirith, once the Steward of Angmar, eternal slave of the Witch-king. He had been wrested from the Void and sent back in a new guise, and as the wraith Gothmog he commands many of the forces of Mordor."/>
<label key="key:620949045:8567448" value="You arrived at the great city of Minas Tirith with little time to spare, as the forces of the Enemy encircle the White City and prepare to mount their siege. From a secret chamber in the Tower of Ecthelion, Steward Denethor wrestled against the despair of Sauron in the depths of the Anor-stone. If no allies come, and soon, the doom of which he speaks must surely fall upon Minas Tirith."/>
<label key="key:620949045:8567473" value="Aragorn has undertaken a dangerous mission: he marches to the Black Gate of Mordor with an army too small to wage serious war against the forces of Sauron. And yet, the Host of the West occupies every thought of the Dark Lord, for he is consumed with fear that Aragorn has obtained the Ring of Power and seeks to install himself as sovereign."/>
<label key="key:620949045:8567479" value="Aragorn's dangerous scheme to draw the eye of the Dark Lord has borne fruit, but it brings an upsetting revelation: Sauron has captured a hobbit within Mordor, and his dark messenger displays tokens of proof: Bilbo's mail-shirt, Sam's short sword, and an Elf-cloak of Lórien. The Quest of the Ring has failed. The Host of the West fights on, but the circle in which it stands draws ever smaller as the end approaches..."/>
<label key="key:620949045:8567481" value="And so it was that the Quest of the Ring came to a successful conclusion, and Sauron was destroyed. In the end, it was not through feat of strength or prowess in combat that the Dark Lord was undone, but by the courage and fortitude of two hobbits, and the mercy they showed to another: Sméagol of the river-folk. He it was who destroyed the Ring and ended the dominion of Sauron."/>

<label key="key:621002018:8567361" value="At the behest of King Thorin you brought Khîl Tale-spinner, a trouble-making Zhélruka, back to his father's home in the Ironfold. You also brought word to Thorin's own son Durin that the time had come for him to learn what it takes to lead. But even as Durin prepared to return to the Lonely Mountain, Khîl discovered a hidden chamber within his father's house, and in that secret room was revealed a black-bound book covered in evil sigils and bearing the Eye of Sauron: the Black Book of Mordor."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567363" value="On your return to the Lonely Mountain you encountered a band of Zhélruka on the border of the Dale-lands. Aggrieved that the messenger they dispatched to King Thorin had not yet returned, they threatened to cross by the base of Erebor, in war if need be, and Durin stayed behind to ease the tension. After bringing the Black Book of Mordor to Gandalf and delivering word of his son to King Thorin, you learned that the Zhélruka passed into the Grey Mountains; unwilling to shed dwarf-blood, Durin followed them instead, vowing to protect the Men of Dale from the possibility of Zhélruka aggression. When you finally caught up to Durin, his heart had been moved by the chill air of the mountains, and he desired to prove himself a worthy son and heir to King Thorin, though it mean risking the ire of Karazgar, the Weeping Warrior."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567364" value="An excursion to the Anvil of Winterstith and a quest for vengeance embroiled the Dwarves of Skarháld in further conflict with Karazgar, the Weeping Warrior, and only the timely intervention of Gandalf staved off disaster. His study of the Black Book of Mordor has borne some fruit, but Karazgar's interest in that forbidding tome has convinced the Wizard that it must not remain in the Grey Mountains."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567369" value="At Gandalf's suggestion you journeyed to the house of Grimbeorn in the Beorning-lands. While you helped his folk make safe their homes and those of their neighbours in the vales of the Anduin, the Wizard continued his study of the Black Book of Mordor. Before long, Elrond and much of his household arrived in the vales on their way to Gondor for the wedding of his daughter Arwen to Aragorn Elessar. They also sought out Grimbeorn, who found his hospitality, and his patience, tested by the arrival of the Elves. Meanwhile, the presence of the Weeping Warrior can still be felt in the vales, and his desire to obtain the Black Book has not lessened."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567377" value="In the wake of Sauron's defeat, the Gúrzyul Ugrukhôr seeks information about a mysterious artifact known only as the Bugdatish, and he sends his minions in search of Karazgar the Weeping Warrior, another of the Gúrzyul who may possess the secret of it. Meanwhile, the Lord and Lady of the Golden Wood come to Dol Guldur, the former stronghold of the Necromancer, and raze it to the ground."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567380" value="The search for Karazgar continued into Eryn Lasgalen and the Dale-lands, bringing you into the confidence of the surviving dwarves of Thorin's Company, who sought answers for the apparent decline of their people's craft-skill. Gandalf came to believe that the Gúrzyul might be experiencing a similar decline, and they seek a means to reverse or counter it."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567392" value="Gandalf sent you from the Vales of Anduin to Imlad Morgul, where you joined the warriors of Gondor seeking to cleanse Imlad Morgul and Minas Morgul at the command of King Elessar. But his were not the only eyes turned on the Dead City, and the Masters of Mordor also sought to take advantage of the Morgul-sorceries laid bare by the defeat of the Witch-king."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567408" value="Hoping to gain insight into the life of the Elf Magoldir, whose name appears within the Black Book of Mordor, Gandalf prevailed upon the shade of Isildur to recount the tale of the Siege of Barad-dûr that concluded the Second Age."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567410" value="The shade of Isildur concluded his tale of the Great Alliance of Elves and Men that brought about the defeat of Sauron at the conclusion of the Second Age, but their victory was bittersweet, for Sauron endured and his evil persisted."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567414" value="Within Barad Cúron, the Tower of the Crescent Moon, you confronted the wraith Gothmog and put an end to his evil designs and those of another of Mordor's Masters. But your victory within the tower raised further questions, and the mystery of the Black Book of Mordor remains..."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567460" value="You delved beyond the Black Gate into the vale of Udûn, where Sauron's armies were equipped for war. The Dark Lord may be gone, but his lieutenants remain and vie for power in the absence of his unifying evil. Chief among these is Ugrukhôr, the Captain of the Pit, who seeks to maintain his command over Udûn from the fortress of Durthang."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567462" value="With the unlikely help of the Khundolar war-leader Ayorzén the Wily, you obtained an heirloom corrupted by its long stay in Gorgoroth. You were able to cleanse it of the evil that encircled it, and Elrond imbued it with the Light of Eärendil, a powerful force for Good that will light your way in the Black Land. You met with Dulgabêth, the former Mouth of Sauron, and listened to his offer of peace. Aragorn deemed it unacceptable, but believes you learned information of use from he who hopes to rule Mordor as Sauron's heir."/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567463" value="The search for information led you further into Gorgoroth, and you learned more about the Gúrzyul and the uneasy alliances they have formed in order to solidify their own domains. More troubling for Gandalf and for Middle-earth is your discovery that Lhaereth the Stained, the Lady of Blight, has returned to Mordor and seeks to perfect her pestilential master-work. She was responsible for the Great Plague that swept Gondor and the lands to the east earlier in the Third Age; does she now hope to finish what she started?"/>
<label key="key:621002018:8567464" value="Your infiltration of Amon Thaur has revealed a troubling development for Middle-earth: the Masters of Mordor have set aside their differences and come together beneath the rule of Lhaereth the Stained, Lady of Blight. A unified Mordor endangers all the Free People: Men, dwarves, Elves, and hobbits alike."/>

<label key="key:621008858:8567376" value="Like the coming of a great storm, Vethúg Wintermind descended upon Erebor in rage and vengeance. Many peoples of the North battled and fell, but in the end, Vethúg sustained a grave wound and flew for the Grey Mountains in defeat."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567377" value="The raven-chief, Arcah, called back her ravens from their spying, but not all made the return journey safely. You rescued a wounded raven from swift cold-drakelings that pursued it onto the slopes of Erebor, and soon after, it was able to fly to Ravenhill. However, the tidings it brought did not bode well for the peoples of the North. Vethúg Wintermind had begun his flight from the Grey Mountains, and he would soon lay his vengeance of upon the North."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567426" value="After the darkness of Mirkwood at last began to recede, Tárasánë, the Green Lady, revealed herself in Caras Tilion. In a powerful vision, Tárasánë revealed that Vethúg Wintermind will come to Erebor, but as merely a harbinger of the true Herald of Winter. Although Tárasánë would not speak of the Herald of Winter's name, she told you that the Herald of Winter once served the will of Morgoth and has dwelt in Middle-earth since the Elders Days. You returned to King Thranduil with these troubling tidings, and he sent word to the Queen Regent and King Under the Mountain."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567431" value="After King Thranduil travelled to Caras Tilion, he was beset by the forces of Karazgar. King Thranduil battled Karazgar in single combat, but before the tide of battle turned, he found himself awoken outside Felegoth as if from a trance. Fearing that Karazgar sought the power of the mysterious Green Lady, King Thranduil sent you to Caras Tilion to challenge Karazgar. You discovered the aftermath of a battle between Elves and the Men of Mordor, but Karazgar left only rust in his wake. The Green Lady was revealed, but her intentions remain unclear. What powers does she possess? Is she of the same kind as the Huntsman of Dunland?"/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567432" value="At long last, Karazgar revealed his designs in Esgaroth-of-old. The broken remains of the cold-drakelings his agents captured from the furthest reaches of the Ered Mithrin had been laid bare among the bones of Smaug the Golden. It was a deception to enrage the greater drakes in the service of the Herald of Winter and turn their ire against the Elves, Men, and dwarves of the North. A dying cold-drake revealed that one of his kin escaped Karazgar's wrath in Esgaroth-of-old and made for the Ered Mithrin to deliver a warning to the Herald of Winter. Despite the efforts of the leaders of the North, it seems the vile plot of the Weeping Warrior has succeeded."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567441" value="You learned that the agents of the Weeping Warrior have been gathering cold-drakelings in Lake-town under the cover of night. After eavesdropping on a conversation between a smuggler and one of Karazgar's servants, you learned that not only does Karazgar hope to use the drakelings to bolster his strength, but also to send a message to the Herald of Winter and the North itself. You also discovered that Karazgar travelled into Eryn Lasgalen, but his purposes remain unclear."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567443" value="After you revealed to King Thorin that Vethúg Wintermind seeks to set siege to Erebor, he prepared to rally the forces of the North to repel the legendary cold-drake. Fearful that Vethúg does indeed serve one greater, he has resolved to slay the cold-drake and avenge his ancestors who dwelt in the Ered Mithrin. After an ill-advised attempt at humour, King Thorin requested that you deliver word to the leaders in the North. Although some offered help only begrudgingly, it seems the North remains united against the servants of the Enemy."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567445" value="At King Thorin's request, you sought an audience with King Thranduil. You offered him a token of peace from the dwarves of Erebor, and delivered a warning that Karazgar now stalked the realm of the Elves. King Thranduil prepared his scouts and you aided in directing them to seek Karazgar among the forest of Eryn Lasgalen. What will their searches reveal?"/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567447" value="Despite learning that Karazgar may have returned to Caras Tilion, King Thranduil was forced to turn his attention to another matter. The Old Mother, Iphantemel, was revealed in Torech Emel, and the time had come at last to claim vengeance upon her for the destruction of Caras Tilion and the blighting of Mirkwood. Far from the hale foe Thranduil once faced, Iphantemel was old and bloated in her excess and she seemed to welcome her death. The spiders were at last purged from Eryn Lasgalen, but only because Ungwetári called her children to the Ephel Dúath for some terrible purpose. King Thranduil became suspicious of Karazgar's intentions in travelling to Caras Tilion and vowed to seek him with a small company of Elves."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567456" value="Fearing that you were misled by the visions of the Green Lady, King Thorin III advised you to seek the counsel of King Thranduil. In turn, King Thranduil suggested you seek the counsel of Lady Galadriel and the power of the Mirror. After travelling to Caras Galadhon, Lady Galadriel did not believe that Karazgar could have come so far south to enter the ruins of Dol Guldur beneath the notice of the Galadhrim. Lady Galadriel consulted the Mirror, but again saw no sign of Karazgar in Dol Dhannen, the name now given to Dol Guldur. Still, she felt that something remained beyond her sight and thought long on what was to be done."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567458" value="After much deliberation, Lady Galadriel travelled to Dol Dhannen with Lord Celeborn, King Thranduil, Sigileth, and you. Your exploration of the ruins of Dol Dhannen nearly proved fruitless until you discovered a small passage leading down into the shadowed tunnels of Gostador. As Lady Galadriel expected, you did not find Karazgar in its depths. However, a great evil still lingered in Gostador and you witnessed shadowy impressions of Karazgar's final dealings with Sauron in Dol Guldur. You learned that Karazgar was promised the entirety of the North once the peoples there were driven out, and that the Weeping Warrior could subjugate or destroy any of the dragons that remained in that realm. You also learned that Hrímil Frost-heart defied Sauron and devoured one of the Dwarf-rings in spite. Following these revelations, you returned to Erebor and informed King Thorin III that Karazgar may still lurk nearby."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567459" value="After learning that Vethúg Wintermind flies for Erebor, the peoples of the North began to ready their defences in earnest. You aided the peoples of Dale, Lake-town, and Felegoth in preparing for battle and defending their homes."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567461" value="In the aftermath of the battle at Erebor, it was revealed by the ravens that Karazgar pursued the wounded Vethúg Wintermind into the Grey Mountains. Much to the dismay of his kinfolk, King Thorin III decreed that no expeditions shall be made into the Grey Mountains for he, Erna, and Thranduil think it wise to remain uninvolved in the conflict between Karazgar and Vethúg Wintermind now that they have left the North."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567463" value="Despite his edict, King Thorin III has heard troubling rumours regarding the forming of an expedition to reclaim Thikil-gundu, the Steel Keep, from the dragons and Orcs of the Grey Mountains. Every dwarf you spoke to denied such an expedition, but King Thorin III remained unconvinced. After talking to the adventurous Dori and learning that he has no intent to defy the King Under the Mountain, he asked you to talk to Nori about a group of dwarves who came to the coffers in the night. To the surprise of all in Erebor, Nori departed and led an expedition into the Grey Mountains. King Thorin III was furious, but he would not violate his own edict. The fate of the expedition to Thikil-gundu is Nori's burden to bear."/>
<label key="key:621008858:8567480" value="While the rest of the North braced for the coming of Vethúg Wintermind, Dís summoned King Thorin III to Ravenhill. To their surprise, the raven-chief, Arcah, had returned from far-off lands and wished to speak with the new King Under the Mountain. After agreeing to honour the old ways between their peoples, Arcah sent her ravens far and wide to spy on both Karazgar and Vethúg Wintermind."/>

<label key="key:621020354:8567396" value="The course of the Gladden did not always run as it does today. During the fighting at the close of the Second Age, Sauron sent forth his dark thought, attempting to rouse great evils to his cause. Whether such calamities responded to him is unknown, but around this time there were massive quakes in the Misty Mountains, shaking the dwarf-halls as far north as the High Pass.&#10;&#10;The upheaval changed the course of the river, carrying sediment downstream and choking the Gladdenmere until its banks overflowed. Water poured over the cliff, flooding the valley and submerging its roads. In this way, the Gladden Fields became a wide marsh of reeds and dark pools. In time the level of the lake was restored, and the Gladden Falls became the narrow torrent it is today."/>
<label key="key:621020354:8567414" value="The High Pass through the Misty Mountains was treacherous and difficult to cross for many years, for both goblin raiders and stone-giants haunted the stones and crags and made travel difficult.

In return they charged a toll for passage, which other folk considered an unfair cost.&#10;&#10;The High Pass was blocked during the War of the Ring, but today the Beornings have cleared it once again. Some say friendly stone-giants aided in this effort, but Grimbeorn's people will not say if this is so."/>

It was rebuilt, and indeed when the Great Alliance marched south to besiege Mordor, it was by way of the Hadhodiant that they crossed the Anduin.&#10;&#10;But the bridge would not last. It broke in the middle, and when artisans from the Iron Hills were summoned to repair it, they were set upon by Orcs and every dwarf was slain. Over the course of centuries, stones of the bridge continued to fall into the river, until at last a tremendous flood swept away much of the ruin.&#10;&#10;With the Hadhodiant destroyed, the Old Ford has come back into service as the primary means of crossing the Anduin in the north."/>

<label key="key:621021015:177082677" value="You have discovered a very old song about the woods and waters of Rhovanion. Perhaps this is what the ancient Elves heard when they listened to the water cascading over the many falls."/>

<label key="key:621021015:8567312" value="You found every stanza for a bit of doggerel the Woodmen of the Vales of Anduin tell to their children: the song of Old Mad Ubb. He sounds like a rather unpleasant creature... and also a little familiar."/>
<label key="key:621021015:8567313" value="You have learned much about the difficulties the Dwarves of Erebor faced in the North, and how those troubles often took a familiar shape: Dragon!"/>
<label key="key:621021015:8567314" value="The lure of the ancient, lost city of Thafar-gathol has entranced the Zhélruka for much of their history, but despite many expeditions into the Grey Mountains it remains hidden, if it ever existed at all. You learned eight stanzas of a song extolling its virtues and its great wealth."/>
<label key="key:621021015:8567315" value="As you discovered in Thikil-gundu, the Steel Keep of the Grey Mountains, not all of Sauron's servants gave up hope at the defeat of their master. Karazgar, the Weeping Warrior, devised a plan to ensnare the Herald of Winter, claiming he would not suffer defeat as Sauron did."/>
<label key="key:621021015:8567393" value="You have learned a song which tells the history of Járnfast. Like the Dwarves of the Iron Hills who dwell there, its fortunes were built almost entirely upon the material that gives that region its name, and the song its refrain: iron hard, and iron cold."/>
<label key="key:621021015:8567398" value="You discovered a number of curious scratches in the hard stone of the Grey Mountains, and with much diligence you uncovered the full story. It is a cruel record of the dragon Smaug, and it tells of his growing fury and his desire for vengeance against the Dwarves of the North."/>
<label key="key:621021015:8567415" value="You have learned about the tradition of the Black Arrow, a tradition which was kept alive by lords of Dale for hundreds of years. How fortunate that it was so! For it was Bard's Black Arrow that at last slew the dragon Smaug."/>
<label key="key:621021015:8567417" value="You have learned a tale of the North that is all-too-familiar, for there are others like it. It is a tale of the enmity between Elves and dwarves, but in this case the tale goes further, to the healing between those folk, and that is a welcome difference."/>

<label key="key:621024918:118018276" value="Few among the living ever heard him speak, but his visage was well-known, and feared. They called him the Grim Southron, and while Men quailed at his approach during the Second Age, during the Third the legend of his malice had only grown. In later days it was he that Lhaereth the Stained followed in secret to Dol Guldur, where she discovered Sauron and helped him recover, for a price. Did the Dark Lord deal out reward or punishment for his Nazgûl's lapse? But that was much later. During the Second Age, the Grim Southron was known only to be patient, loyal, and silent."/>

He rarely left the dungeon fastnesses of Mordor, for he delighted in the working of foul rituals and the mastery of fell magics, and gave his thought to little else. But when the Dark Lord saw fit to send him forth, Men and Elves knew to give him a wide berth, or suffer.

<label key="key:621025421:8567394" value="The pass of Cirith Ungol was rarely left unguarded, but few only would dare to make the crossing while the Orcs of the tower could spy on them from above. The worse and far greater danger was spoken of only in whispers, for few good folk knew even rumour of it. Some dark terror dwelled in the tunnel of Torech Ungol, through which the path must lead. Even should a traveller make it safely through the web-haunted passage, the tunnel gave way to a chasm open to the sky but riddled with cave-mouths on each cliffside from which any foe might have the advantage of surprise.

<label key="key:621032470:8567312" value="As the dwarves press on into Gundabad every member of the Gabil'akkâ is called upon to fight, but not everyone is well-suited to the task. Eskil Bloodthumb, apprentice of sculptor Stáli the Hewer, is one such dwarf, and when he runs into trouble in the depths of the Deepscrave he needs your help to escape not only the clutches of the Orcs, but his apprenticeship to Stáli as well."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567314" value="Mysteries abound as you explore the further reaches of Gundabad, encountering strange enchantments in both the Pit of Stonejaws and the snowy heights of Câr Bronach. You and your allies bravely stand against the plots of both hobgoblin warriors and Angmarim cultists, but a strange and threatening power blankets the Mountain-home, and both its source and purpose remain hidden from you."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567316" value="The Gabil'akkâ suffers a heartbreaking defeat as Gorgar attacks the primary foothold of the dwarves in Gundabad, but the deaths at his command are not the only weapon he wields against the Longbeard prince. He wields a mighty hammer made of mithril, and with it he strikes a crushing blow against the dwarves. 'Are you the same as I am?' he asks Durin before departing, and although the prince shrugs off the question, it still troubles him.&#10;&#10;Durin asks you to venture further into Gundabad with dual missions: to avenge those lost at Gorgar's hands, and to stymie the efforts of the Angmarim as they delve into places held sacred by the dwarves."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567318" value="The Gabil'akkâ captures a goblin named Glúrkub who served high in Gorgar's counsels before the onset of the War of Three Peaks. The words he speaks in captivity shake the very foundation of Prince Durin's belief in himself and his cause, but there is hope as well. If Glúrkub can be believed, Gorgar meets with Hrímil Frost-heart at a high place above the Welkin-lofts, and when he does he leaves the mithril hammer behind. Durin seizes upon this possibility, but he remains full of anger and distrust."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567320" value="Deep below Gundabad, secrets are revealed that shake Prince Durin's resolve, but with your help he masters his feelings and comes to terms with the complicated legacy of his forebears."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567396" value="Prince Durin marshals his troops for battle, and the War of Three Peaks begins! The fighting ebbs and flows as the Orcs mount a ferocious defence, but early successes on the part of the Gabil'akkâ are not enough to secure outright victory. Tensions flare between the various dwarf-clans, despite their common enemy, and arguments between Longbeard, Zhélruka, and Stout-axe threaten to undermine the war effort. At last Durin marches for the gates of Gundabad to face Gorgar in combat, but just as victory seems assured a terrible roar sounds from the heights: Hrímil Frost-heart has broken free of her icy prison behind the Anvil of Winterstith, and she claims lordship of Gundabad. Durin sounds the retreat, but he vows not to relinquish the Mountain-home to this new intruder, or any other.&#10;&#10;The next chapter will begin with Prince Durin, located either in Zarkul-sulûn during the War of Three Peaks or in Annâk-khurfu in Elderslade."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567399" value="Worrisome rumours that Gorgar the Ruthless, son of Bolg and brother of Mazog, has named himself 'Lord of Gundabad' compels Glóin to send a warning to Prince Durin Stonehelmson. The warning is appreciated but not heeded: nothing will stop Durin's assault upon Gundabad. He calls for armies of dwarves to descend upon the Elderslade in preparation for the upcoming conflict, including survivors of the Iron Garrison. These brave dwarves intend to secure the victory that eluded them in Moria, but not all of them are confident it will be possible."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567400" value="Durin and Ingór, princes of the Longbeards and of the Zhélruka, command their combined forces to break through the ice with which Hrímil Frost-heart sealed the gates of Gundabad. Once beyond, the Gabil'akkâ begins its effort to seize control of the mighty court of Máttugard."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567460" value="Durin has called for your help at the fortress of Skarháld in the Grey Mountains, where he seeks to unite the dwarf-clans there assembled: Stout-axes, Zhélruka, and Longbeards. Fearing that his own people will be outnumbered by the other clans, he sends for reinforcements from the Lonely Mountain; his father King Thorin Stonehelm responds by directing a large army of Longbeards, many of them veterans of the distant Great Orc War and the more-recent Battle of Five Armies to join his son. Tensions run high, but they do not prevent Durin from setting his sights upon a valuable and hard-to-win prize: Gundabad, sacred Mountain-home, currently held by Orcs."/>
<label key="key:621032470:8567462" value="In advance of Durin's stated purpose to seize Gundabad, the son of King Thorin Stonehelm sent scouts into the Wells of Langflood. They return with news of an Orkish raiding-party dispatched from the fortress, and Durin sends you to counter it before it can slay the inhabitants of the Wells, or hinder the plans for his army's assault upon the Mountain-home. You dispatch the raiding-party, but before its leader dies he speaks of Gorgar the Ruthless, new Lord of Gundabad, son of Bolg and brother to Mazog, who troubled the dwarves greatly in their attempt to retake Moria."/>

It was never sacked, but in time it stood empty and Orcs prowled the ruin.&#10;&#10;Today, worms and drakes have built nests among the skeletons of ancient buildings, and Framsburg is theirs.

Throughout its long dormancy, the Orcs avoided and scorned it, and thinking it cursed, they renamed it Shalgaush: the Bonefinger. Indeed, even during the ill-fated rebirth of Angmar, neither the False King of Angmar nor his servants returned to lay claim to the Drearspire.

<label key="key:621049867:218639268" value="On this page, Brom lists a number of follow-up moves to use against opponents who have been consumed with rage following the successful execution of the 'look at the thrush!' manoeuvre detailed on a previous page. Most of these seem to rely upon beating a hasty retreat."/>
<label key="key:621049867:218639269" value="On this page, Brom goes into great detail on the differences between a 'thump' and a 'wallop.' As terms of art, they leave much to be desired."/>
<label key="key:621049867:218639270" value="On this page, Brom asks the question 'Is the most valuable punch the one you never need to throw?'&#10;&#10;His answer: 'no.'"/>
<label key="key:621049867:218639271" value="On this page, Brom lists a number of vulnerable spots a skilled brawler might target with punches in order to debilitate his opponents. Unfortunately, his understanding of anatomy is less than thorough, and most of his advice only applies to humanoid opponents."/>
<label key="key:621049867:218639272" value="On this page, Brom suggests that if you intend to brawl with spiders or other crawling insects, you should purchase another of his books, 'Knowledge of Kicks,' for valuable advice on dealing with such creatures. 'I will not here describe what type of attack you will need,' he writes, 'but it is not a punch of any kind!'&#10;&#10;You suspect he may be referring to kicks, but with Brom it is hard to say."/>
<label key="key:621049867:218639273" value="On this page, Brom notes that many brawlers never master the art of the perfect punch, despite studying from the best trainers Middle-earth has on offer. 'This reflects poorly on the student, and not on the teachers,' he insists."/>

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;The Art of the Perfect Punch was written by Brom Hawksbeard, a brawler from Bree-land.&#10;&#10;Many of the pages in the middle of the book have gone missing."/>
<label key="key:621049867:8567440" value="On this page, Brom discusses the importance of landing successive blows with alternating fists. You wonder why he waited until page 49 to describe this significant element of combat."/>
<label key="key:621049867:94621395" value="You should search for missing pages from The Art of the Perfect Punch throughout Angmar and the Misty Mountains."/>
<label key="key:621049879:118018273" value="On this page, Brom recommends a simple means of improving the accuracy of your kicks: by setting an apple atop a wooden fence-post, closing your eyes, and attempting to strike the apple from its place with your foot.&#10;&#10;'If you are able to do this,' Brom writes, 'you can graduate to smaller apples and higher posts.'"/>
<label key="key:621049879:118018274" value="On this page, Brom engages in a lengthy detour discussing punches instead of kicks. At the bottom of the page he recommends that you consult another of his books, 'The Art of the Perfect Punch,' for even more melee-related material.&#10;&#10;You wonder if that book is full of information about kicks, and who suggested Brom write these books in the first place."/>
<label key="key:621049879:118018275" value="On this page, Brom has drawn a number of diagrams intended to demonstrate the proper form of three powerful kicks. Unfortunately, his artistic skills are rather less than his brawling prowess, and the drawings are impossible to understand."/>
<label key="key:621049879:118018276" value="On this page, Brom details the problems and pitfalls of attempting to strike an opponent with your foot while jumping. 'Unless you are quite fast,' he writes, 'your opponent may be able to grab your leg during the approach, and then where will you be? Leave this manoeuvre to the experts!'"/>
<label key="key:621049879:118018277" value="On this page, Brom continues his apparently heart-felt prohibition against jump-kicks. 'Trust me, dear reader,' he writes, 'you do not want to jump at someone with your foot extended, only to have them grab you out of midair. It would be humiliating... I assume.'&#10;&#10;You suspect the author of Knowledge of Kicks had a bad experience executing this sort of manoeuvre at some point in his history."/>
<label key="key:621049879:118018278" value="On this page, Brom discusses the importance of kicking with both your left and right legs.&#10;&#10;'But not at the same time,' he concludes."/>
<label key="key:621049879:118018279" value="On this page, Brom compares the art of brawling with your feet to the practice of dancing. 'But not like they do it at court,' he continues. 'Brawling with your feet is much nearer the sort of dance you'd find at a country inn... and more fun, too!'"/>
<label key="key:621049879:118018280" value="On this page, Brom recommends the purchase of another of his books, Martial Movement. Between the covers of that 'fine investment' he promises to explain a number of manoeuvres that will allow you to dodge the type of kicks you have learned from this tome.&#10;&#10;'But don't worry,' he writes, 'for your opponents will not have read it.'"/>

<label key="key:621049890:118018273" value="On this page, Brom discusses the importance of knowing when to dodge an oncoming attack.

<label key="key:621049890:118018275" value="On this page, Brom has sketched a diagram that contains entirely too many feet to follow. 'As you can see,' he writes, 'it is very important to keep your feet moving while you are in the thick of the fighting.'"/>
<label key="key:621049890:118018277" value="On this page, Brom claims to have invented the well-known adage that the best defence is a good offence.

Among the fruit trees, vegetables, and flowers were grape seeds. Forstóri ordered great pergolas to be crafted to bear the weight of the heavy vines. From the vineyards of Maranazhâr came the incomparable Zigilmarn, a wine of such delicate yet complex tastes that even the Elves still speak of it with a hushed awe."/>
<label key="key:621050642:137079112" value="Ancient records of Clovengap speak of tiers of heavy-laden fruit trees planted in neat rows upon the western tiers. Whatever may once have grown in gardens and orchards here is long gone, ripped out by the roots by Orcs, Wargs, and other intruders to Clovengap. The Orcs call these woods Skarashulg, or \qWarg-woods,\q for the twisted beasts who make their dens here among bone and rock."/>
<label key="key:621050642:137079113" value="In days long ago, too numerous to count, a dragon fell from the sky, its body pierced with dwarf-made weapons. Into Clovengap he crashed, and slithered like a giant worm into a tunnel he found behind one of the thunderous falls. Deep into the ground he poured his body, his life failing but his hatred burning fierce. The light went out in his eyes, the scales fell from flesh, flesh from bone.&#10;&#10;Eons passed, and the bones themselves began to crack and break. As they split, the wickedness seeped from them, poisoning the waters in his death chamber cavern. From the waters, crystals grew, their depths swirling with corruption. From even deeper, an ancient evil clawed his way up, out, called to the cavern by the corruption."/>

Now they make a living harvesting the strong lumber of Mitheithel, as well as by selling the small wood carvings that are Glenys's craft-in-trade. Their son Bran explores the nearby woods, often getting into trouble of his own, but he has thus far managed to also get himself out of it, which his father notes with some pride to all those he meets."/>

Unlike several other encampments of the Dúnedain, Tornhad has managed to remain a more or less permanent settlement of that folk, primarily as a result of their ability to flee to caves in the hills when danger seems near to discovering them.&#10;&#10;In time of peace, Tornhad is home to many families of Rangers, and the children learn their ways of survival at a young age; some of them are additionally fostered in Rivendell, receiving instruction in history, art, and craft. With war seeming to loom on the horizon, many of the Dúnadan women and children have already removed to the safety of their hidden caves, while others arm for battle and roam the wilderness, keeping the roads clear at Aragorn's command."/>

However, the keep itself was to be the site of a grievous defeat during the War of the Elves and Sauron, when the fearless captain Oranoril lured the armies of Sauron to the fortress, where she and her company met their deaths.&#10;&#10;And yet Oranoril's sacrifice is not remembered as a defeat, for it was by her actions and those of her chosen warriors that many of the Eldar were able to flee to the newly-founded haven of Imladris, in the Misty Mountains, where they survived the depravities of Sauron and regrouped for the counterattack that would eventually lead to his downfall for a time."/>
<label key="key:621062414:137079106" value="A thousand years into the Third Age, a line of the hól-budlan calling themselves Stôrs crossed the mountains in search of a hospitable place to live. They founded the settlement of Glynafon, which became home to a number of thriving homesteads among the rocks and trees of the Angle.&#10;&#10;The Stôrs lived peaceably in Glynafon for about three hundred years, but with unrest in Rhudaur and the growing threat of the Witch-king's young kingdom of Angmar, they were forced to abandon the Angle in search of new lands."/>
<label key="key:621062414:137079109" value="The forests of the Trollshaws and the Angle are littered with ruins of the petty-kingdom of Rhudaur, a province troubled by both the trolls of the Trollshaws and the Amonedain that lived in the Angle before the coming of the Dúnedain. Rhudaur would in time succumb to both external pressure and internal betrayal, and the Angle would become a borderland, a frontier known by some as Harnaith, the south-point, and by others as an untamable wilderness better left to trolls and hill-men.&#10;&#10;Whatever foul deeds were done within Ost Waeren at the behest of the Witch-king's servants have been thankfully forgotten by Men, but the watchful stones and the blood-soaked earth remembers."/>

They helped finish the construction of Thelgarth, which became a bulwark against an attack from the south that never came.&#10;&#10;The threat instead would come from the north, when the kingdom of Arnor splintered into the three petty-kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. When this last fell under the sway of the Witch-king's corruption, the citadel of Thelgarth held out the longest, serving as the seat of its surviving Dúnadan kings even in the face of Angmar's growing evil. When the King of Rhudaur and all of his household, save one, were murdered at the command of the Witch-king, the last princess of Rhudaur secretly sheltered in Thelgarth.&#10;&#10;But plague and the rising power of Angmar would spell doom for the Dúnedain. In 1637, Angmarim cultists threw down the walls of Thelgarth and slaughtered its defenders in a massacre that came to be known as the Night of Red Waters. The Angle remained desolate for hundreds of years after that, but in time half-orcs and brigands crept into the abandoned ruins of Thelgarth, unaware of its long and troubled history."/>

The import of this family would not be made clear for many years, but the line of Hamfast of Gamwich would eventually prove crucial in the history of not only the Shire but also of Middle-earth itself. The Gamwich name would change over time, first to Gammidge, and then ultimately to Gamgee.

This was rumoured to be one of the reasons for their wealth, for various Tucks and Tooks were said to have found strange treasures among the ruins on the edges of the Shire. Most other hobbits viewed this behaviour as queer, but Tookishness was a point of pride among many members of the family who shared the restless mindset of \qOld Nuncle Blanco.\q&#10;&#10;One of the places they liked to roam was the Yondershire, and they were more wont to interact with the Rangers there; from them they learned much skill at arms. It became the custom for younger sons and daughters of the Thain to serve as Reeves, unofficial guardians of those lands, helping to keep the Orcs and other fell things that lurked there at bay. In the time of Ferumbras I, the third Took-thain, they founded Nobottle in the southern fringes of Yondershire; this new village, the first sizable new hobbit-hold in centuries, was soon thriving, and became known for the quality of its barley and ale.

Both the Elves of Lindon and the Men that would come to be known as Hill-folk often fared into the wilds, but they made few permanent settlements here. Tham Amothir was one such, and it served as a way-station for the folk of Gil-galad that came here to hunt.&#10;&#10;The Elves called this country Arassien, the Stag-lands, for Gil-galad and his kin often hunted the great harts and hinds that ranged here. After the death of Gil-galad, Círdan used the ring he had been gifted to preserve the woodlands of Arassien in the old king's memory, though the shipwright himself was much more concerned with the building of ships and the crossing of the Sea.&#10;&#10;Today, folk of Yondershire can see the beauty of the Elf-ruins that remain, but they find it hard to imagine what Tham Amothir might have looked like when it was new."/>

Beyond these the countryside remained wild, and while the hobbits set wardens called Bounders to watch over those lands, none settled there at first. These lands they called the Yondershire, to distinguish its roughness from the more pleasant vales of the Shire Proper, or, more formally, the Hithershire.&#10;&#10;Marcho settled into his hall in Michel Delving, where the other Shire-folk named him Mayor, and he grew fat and comfortable. Blanco, who led the Bounders, still felt the call to wander, and he took to roaming far and wide, visiting the King in Annúminas, the Elves in Lindon, and the Dwarves in Ered Luin. Closer to home, he tarried in the wilds of Yondershire, and built his own modest home at Long Cleeve, a steep-walled dale in the southern slopes of the Twilight Hills, under the shadow of Bâr Faroth’s ruins, where the Water had its source.&#10;&#10;Long Cleeve has been the home of the North-tooks and the seat of the Reeves of Yondershire since the time of Bandobras Took, who dwelt there until (and after) he was called to defend his folk from outside enemies."/>

They seek peaceful coexistence with the folk of Mossward on the other side of the Old South Road, and so far the two peoples have managed to get along without serious incident. The one exception: children of Mossward are particularly interested in the dangers that lurk just beneath the surface of the marshes, and scouts of Lhan Garan have had to rescue wayward children and send them back home.

She parried his feeble stab and disarmed him, sending the blade clattering to the ground. The thief felt the bite of cold steel against his neck, and he froze.&#10;'The only reason I am giving you this chance is that you did not harm the woman from whom you stole.'&#10;She withdrew her blade, and the thief's hands snapped to his neck, checking for blood. He found none. By the time he recovered himself, the Ranger's back was to him. She was walking away.&#10;He looked to where his dagger had fallen, then to the Ranger, and decided to do the same."/>

<label key="key:621066959:8567441" value="The stone walls of this throne room were once decorated with rich tapestries, and lush carpets lined the floors. From here ruled the princes, and one regent-princess, of Cardolan."/>
<label key="key:621066959:8567443" value="Though weathered by time, you can make out faint writing on the large obelisk. It speaks of Artandil and Malgun, kings who met atop this hill, and who felled each other with simultaneous fatal blows.&#10;&#10;Thence fell Artandil and Malgun…&#10;&#10;Dread thorn pierces heart,&#10;War branch striketh eye.&#10;Raven wine fast streaming,&#10;Deadmount corpse heavy.&#10;Battle swellers wholly slaughtered,&#10;Forest slinkers hunger-appeased."/>
<label key="key:621066959:8567445" value="This site is a memorial to the victims of the Great Plague of 1636. Nearly all occupants of Tharbad, Dol Ernil, and Gond Orchal succumbed to the plague, their bodies requiring burning instead of the usual barrow internment. Fearful of the sickness passing to the living, the bodies were burned in huge pyres without the usual ceremonies. It is said that the sky above Cardolan was grey and that ash fell for days upon the land.&#10;&#10;The ashes of the victims were gathered and transported here, mixed together and dumped by the grieving survivors, who then piled stones atop the mound, in hopes of keeping angry spirits at rest. There is no record of the names of the dead, for they were too many in number, and most of those who put the bodies to the torch fell themselves to the illness."/>
<label key="key:621066959:8567447" value="In those days, a fog rolled over the land, from whence emerged a plague of the Dead who slew all before them. Most fearsome of these was a wraith-like figure known as Hithrengor, the Grey Fear, who terrorized Dol Ernil. Luilloth brought her young son Ostir to Fornost for his protection while her husband, Prince Ostecthel, hunted down the source of the evil.&#10;&#10;Prince Ostecthel strode into the fog a mighty warrior in his prime... only to later stumble out looking as though he had aged decades. With gasping words he revealed that the evil had been banished and that the land was safe once more. Aggrieved but proud, Luilloth returned and served as princess-regent until Ostir came of age. The people loved her, for she was good and kind, and ruled wisely.&#10;&#10;Ostecthel's words were soon proven wrong, however! Once more, the Dead rose and ravaged Cardolan, while Ostir and his few remaining knights fell back, retreating north. Is it not known where Luilloth had been, but tales say that when Ostir and his army did not return, she set out to aid them. She found only her son's loyal canine howling among the Downs, and Luilloth knew then that Ostir was dead, for Astoryn would never leave his master's side.&#10;&#10;Luilloth and Astoryn went north to seek guidance, following whispers of some great power that dwelt in the forest. She was never seen again, but the ravening Dead quieted soon after and vanished back into the mists."/>

<label key="key:621066960:137079090" value="This crumbled ruin once housed a powerful artifact atop its tower: Ambossar, the black-veined Vandassar. Here it was the Dúnedain forged bonds of peace with the Amonedain of Cardolan. Oaths were sworn by chieftains, and the Hill-folk were made compliant... for a time.&#10;&#10;Agents of Angmar would later destroy the tower and shatter the Vandassar, leading to the dissolution of the bonds with the Hill-folk, and their subsequent retaliation."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079092" value="Time has erased the memory of the builders who made the standing stone at Gond Orchal, and for whom they erected it. Ancestors of the Amonedain treated this as a sacred site, but over the years it has seen horror as well."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079094" value="In days long past, the Amonedain built the shining stone halls of Haudh Nirui, where lie entombed several of their lords and families. Much of what remains has long since turned to dust, but the halls remain."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079095" value="Once a great city of Arnor and a seat of princes, Caranost was also known as the Red Fort. It was sacked by Angmar during the decline of Cardolan.&#10;&#10;The towers of Caranost commanded a wide view of a large expanse of the northern region of Cardolan, but when the city was taken many of the towers were destroyed."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079097" value="Once a great stronghold on the edge of the Wadewater, Nímbarth now lies in ruin, home to evils that serve the Enemy against which it was intended to defend."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079105" value="Local legends speak of terraced gardens that once sprawled across the hill known as Nettinglade. Long before it was the home of terrible spiders spinning their deadly silks, it was a beautiful place of flowers, fruits, and fountains.&#10;&#10;It is said even the Lady Galadriel herself toured the paths in ancient days, wandering with a soft smile among the roses."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079107" value="Deep within the Old Forest, the flooded tombs of Sarch Vorn have remained hidden for many years. Finely-crafted graves mark the resting places of nobles and royals, kings and queens of ages long past, but their names are now forgotten and the tombs have become a den of evil.&#10;&#10;Older still are the standing stones with their swirled carvings and ancient symbols of a people lost to time."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079109" value="Rumour states the ruins of Everstead were once a small estate belonging to a queen of ancient days. The towers that granted a picturesque view over the river Gwathló have since toppled, and none but the wildlife come here now."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079111" value="Though not quite as established as their neighbours at Scurloc Farm, the Hove family has maintained a hardscrabble livelihood on their own small farm. In recent days, however, the family has been driven out by goblin raiders from the north."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079113" value="Like the ebb and flow of the Gwathló, the fortunes of Tharbad have fallen, risen, and fallen again throughout the centuries. Built long ago by the Númenóreans as a settlement and ford, its bridges, dikes, and dams have been destroyed and rebuilt numerous times.&#10;&#10;Thanks to its position alongside the river and the North-South Road, most trade between the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor passed through Tharbad. As the burghers of the city grew richer, the Dúnedain undertook to deepen the channel at the ford, allowing for ships of greater draught to pass. The fens and waterways of Swanfleet were dredged and drained, with extensive dikes built to support nearby farmlands.&#10;&#10;Tharbad grew grander and more prosperous through trade with Gondor, the Elves, and the dwarves. But its enemies were many, and the city was often ravaged. Each time it was destroyed, the city clawed its way back, its leaders repairing, reforging, and renewing the causeway. However, when the Great Plague swept across Cardolan, its rulers could no longer keep up with the needed repairs.&#10;&#10;Tharbad met its final demise slowly, as the elements battered the weakened structures. Finally, after the Fell Winter, a sudden thaw created a rushing wall of water that decimated the last bits of the crossings over the Gwathló and ruined the Great Bridge once and for all.&#10;&#10;Now the ruined city clings to the banks of a river whose hungry currents carry away more and more of its jagged remains every year."/>
<label key="key:621066960:137079121" value="The name of this once luxuriant home, surrounded on each side by the flowing waters, has been lost to time.

<label key="key:621072002:118018273" value="On this page, Brom discusses the importance of knowing when to dodge an oncoming attack. 'Depending on the attack's direction,' he writes, 'you may wish to duck! However, if your foe has made an overhead swing with some heavy object, a quick side-step may be more appropriate.'"/>
<label key="key:621072002:118018275" value="On this page, Brom has sketched a diagram that contains entirely too many feet to follow. 'As you can see,' he writes, 'it is very important to keep your feet moving while you are in the thick of the fighting.'"/>
<label key="key:621072002:118018277" value="On this page, Brom claims to have invented the well-known adage that the best defence is a good offence.

<label key="key:621072002:118018278" value="On this page, Brom suggests that you practice your most agile manoeuvres on the windiest day you can find. 'That way,' he writes, 'you'll be able to move even faster when the air is still and calm!'"/>

<label key="key:621072002:218639268" value="On this page, Brom discusses a number of different feints you can use to disorient your opponents, including such diversions as the Whoops Not That Way, the Over Here Not There, and the Too Fast For You."/>
<label key="key:621072002:218639269" value="On this page, Brom floats a disturbing hypothetical situation. 'In the event you find yourself engaged in combat with a TBDCLASS who is also familiar with the contents of this book, you may find yourself locked in a perpetual dance of dodging and weaving, with neither combatant able to land a successful blow!'&#10;&#10;Brom has no further advice to counter this situation; he apparently just thought it was interesting."/>
<label key="key:621072002:218639270" value="On this page, Brom notes the importance of maintaining complete focus when engaged in the middle of a whirling storm of battle. 'Only a heightened sense of awareness can enable you to side-step whatever projectiles might be coming your way,' he writes.&#10;&#10;Toward the bottom of the page he seems to contradict himself. 'Sometimes you might need some luck on your side,' he notes. 'But reading such instructive texts as these is ultimately the most important thing, of course. Thanks for buying my book!'"/>

<label key="key:621072019:118018273" value="On this page, Brom recommends a simple means of improving the accuracy of your kicks: by setting an apple atop a wooden fence-post, closing your eyes, and attempting to strike the apple from its place with your foot.&#10;&#10;'If you are able to do this,' Brom writes, 'you can graduate to smaller apples and higher posts.'"/>
<label key="key:621072019:118018274" value="On this page, Brom engages in a lengthy detour discussing punches instead of kicks. At the bottom of the page he recommends that you consult another of his books, 'The Art of the Perfect Punch,' for even more melee-related material.&#10;&#10;You wonder if that book is full of information about kicks, and who suggested Brom write these books in the first place."/>
<label key="key:621072019:118018275" value="On this page, Brom has drawn a number of diagrams intended to demonstrate the proper form of three powerful kicks. Unfortunately, his artistic skills are rather less than his brawling prowess, and the drawings are impossible to understand."/>
<label key="key:621072019:118018276" value="On this page, Brom details the problems and pitfalls of attempting to strike an opponent with your foot while jumping. 'Unless you are quite fast,' he writes, 'your opponent may be able to grab your leg during the approach, and then where will you be? Leave this manoeuvre to the experts!'"/>
<label key="key:621072019:118018277" value="On this page, Brom continues his apparently heart-felt prohibition against jump-kicks. 'Trust me, dear reader,' he writes, 'you do not want to jump at someone with your foot extended, only to have them grab you out of midair. It would be humiliating... I assume.'&#10;&#10;You suspect the author of Knowledge of Kicks had a bad experience executing this sort of manoeuvre at some point in his history."/>

<label key="key:621072019:118018279" value="On this page, Brom compares the art of brawling with your feet to the practice of dancing. 'But not like they do it at court,' he continues. 'Brawling with your feet is much nearer the sort of dance you'd find at a country inn... and more fun, too!'"/>
<label key="key:621072019:118018280" value="On this page, Brom recommends the purchase of another of his books, Martial Movement.

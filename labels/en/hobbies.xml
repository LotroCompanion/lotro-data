<label key="key:620804783:173989215" value="Have you always wanted to relax by a stream or pond, cast your line into the sparkling waters, and catch a fantastic flounder or a perfect pike? With the Fishing hobby, now you can! Just find an ideal fishing spot – any body of water will do, but some will be more bountiful than others – and equip your fishing rod. Cast your line with the Fishing Action button, wait until something takes the bait, and push the Fishing Action button again to reel in your catch. Hopefully it's the fish of your dreams, and not the one that got away!&#10;Minimum Level: 5"/>

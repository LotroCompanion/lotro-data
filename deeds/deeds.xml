The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Lore of the Blade seems to be a rather unusual tome for a Lore-master to express interest in. Rather than delving deeply into the hidden mysteries of mountains, or discussing at length the habits of wave and wind, it reads more like a rousing tale of adventure written to entertain hobbit-children. The pages of Lore of the Blade claim to follow the adventures of a brave young Lore-master who when confronted with deadly dangers is just as apt to fight her way through with flashing swordplay as to confound her opponents with the lore of the elements or the wisdom of long forgotten sages. Oddly, as you find yourself drawn into the stirring tale you begin to see the more subtle nuances of the story unfold through the eyes of its character, who displays an uncanny insight into the nature of the foes she faces, and an understanding of when the strength of arms applied at the correct moment may indeed be the least destructive course.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, some prior reader has handled this copy rather poorly and some of the pages are torn beyond repair. The author also proves to be a bit difficult to pin down, as he has chosen to identify himself solely by the runic letter 'G' inscribed on the binding." objectives="">

The Book of Beasts speaks at great length of the bonds which may be formed between creatures of the wilds and those among the Free Peoples of Middle-earth who are willing to understand their own true natures. It further claims that the Wise might even learn the tongues of the wild creatures of the world and may coax them to greater feats of bravery and strength than would otherwise be possible for a beast lacking in its own will to strive and accomplish.&#10;&#10;Whomever transcribed this particular copy, alas, does not appear to have been entirely in his right mind.

<inventoryItem index="4" loreInfo="This page again delves into bears...after a fashion.&#10;&#10;It describes a unique tribe of the animals -- unique at first in that they can be called a tribe, which is not common among bears, and secondly because the author proposes that these creatures can in fact take upon themselves the shape of Men should they find the need to do so!&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the author seems prepared to guard the secret of this tribe rather jealously, offering no hints as to where these 'bear-men' might be found." progressOverride="The Book of Beasts, page 25" itemId="1879052182" itemName="The Book of Beasts, Page 25"/>
<inventoryItem index="5" loreInfo="This page discusses the nature of the crebain, a particularly devious form of crow, depending on how you choose to classify them.&#10;&#10;These birds are widely known to have a predeliction for mischief, but the author feels that it goes considerably deeper than that, suggesting that long ago their kind were offered a pact by some dark power in return for an intellect and cunning that extends well beyond that common among animals -- a pact which they accepted and that has bound them through ages since in thrall to that power." progressOverride="The Book of Beasts, page 26" itemId="1879052183" itemName="The Book of Beasts, Page 26"/>

He draws a stark comparison between the common spiders that you might find within your garden or basement, and those breeds that grow to dreadful sizes and display a hateful cunning and hunger.&#10;&#10;While most folk presume that these deadly creatures are simply greater forms of the more common spiders, the mysterious author suggests that these two branches of spider-kind are entirely unrelated. Indeed, he seems to suggest that all of the forms of giant spiders can in fact describe their lineage from a single horrifying monster who existed in long ages past, and that it is from her that their intelligence as well as their grotesque size are descended." progressOverride="The Book of Beasts, page 33" itemId="1879052184" itemName="The Book of Beasts, Page 33"/>
<inventoryItem index="7" loreInfo="Sitting towards the end of the book, this page delves into the power of a mysterious tribe of bear-men, noting that their power suggests a maleability of form that derives from the nature of the spirit -- even amongst Men. The author surmises that perhaps some nature of those who formed the world is present in some tribes of Men, and that this may be what grants them such powers that others lack? Or perhaps that nature is present in all Men, and only some few have learned the secret of it?&#10;&#10;The author then rambles on a bit and supposes that the most likely answer is that they are really bears after all, and perhaps bears of a particularly foolish sort if they have chosen to take on the forms of Men.

Stranger still, she had no teaching in song or music, and yet could compose such melodies as to bring tears to the powerful and the Wise. She claimed that she composed no songs, and that she was simply trying to duplicate a music that she could hear -- a music that she claimed arose from the world itself, from mountains, streams, wind, and tree alike, in infinite variety.&#10;&#10;Melodies of the Valar is the book that contains these songs as the Elves transcribed them, but most of the copies of this book have been taken away into the West, and very few remain in Middle-earth today.

<inventoryItem index="5" loreInfo="This song is a victory march from Gondor, written to celebrate the grand victory of the Last Alliance over the forces of darkness and the fall of Sauron.

In fact, you find it difficult to determine who might have written such a piece, for it does not adhere to the principles common to any of the Free Peoples -- and it is certainly no work of Orc or Dragon -- but the mystery only adds to its cachet as a unique and vibrant work of art." progressOverride="The Rising Chord, page 28" itemId="1879052893" itemName="The Rising Chord, Page 28"/>

This book is one of the rare few that survived the fall of the kingdom of Númenor, coming across the waves by some unlikely circumstance to Middle-earth, where it has lain hidden for ages. Though written in the Sindarin tongue, the songs are those of the noble kingdoms of Men. Nevertheless, they speak to the heart of any who would face battle, calling forth visions of endless, shining hosts on the march, thundering with the clash of steel in a thousand voices.&#10;&#10;In the hands of a minstrel, these songs of martial eminence provide crucial insight into the working of the warrior's heart and how it might be aroused from its slumber in times of need.

<inventoryItem index="5" loreInfo="According to this passage, Knee-breaker would often as not neglect to even follow up upon his own surprising assaults, preferring to leave most of the battle to his underlings so that he could keep the situation entirely under his supervision and not be drawn into a melee unecessarily.&#10;&#10;This apparently made it even more difficult for one of his untrustworthy followers to turn upon him at a crucial moment and gave him the opportunity to land the showy finishing blow should he feel a need to display his own prowess to his followers." progressOverride="Knee-breaker's Manual, page 15" itemId="1879052144" itemName="Knee-breaker's Manual, Page 15"/>

To the surprise of all, the lad seemed to have taken to the course of battles and war like a fish to water -- as much as any hobbit could, at any rate. However, he seemed dismissive of the regimentation and orderly nature of the Muster, referring to them as a band of 'useless fops and dandies what hadn't a notion which end of a pike they ought to be on'.&#10;&#10;It seems that he then went about forming his own little band of ruffians and skirmishers from among those hobbits of the more aggressive sort that he could convince to join him -- an act of insubordination that surely would have seen him in irons if they had not quickly proven themselves to be among the most proficient scouts and ambushers in the entire force." progressOverride="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, page 7" itemId="1879177865" itemName="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 7"/>

<inventoryItem index="6" loreInfo="This page describes Adelbert's fighting style as he taught it to his companions during the campaign. It emphasizes a quick and savage assault, often aimed at the strongest leader or beast among the enemy forces in a bid to both eliminate the most dangerous threat and demoralize the enemy at a single stroke.&#10;&#10;The most telling drawback of the method is that the battle will quickly turn against the small assailants if a powerful enemy manages to withstand the attack for more than a few moments, so it entails considerable risk and a readiness to flee swiftly if things do not go their way." progressOverride="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, page 24" itemId="1879177869" itemName="The Expert's Guide to Dirty Fighting, Page 24"/>

<inventoryItem index="3" loreInfo="The battle began on a mist-enshrouded morning, as the valiant men of Gondor fell upon the vanguard of the 'invading' host, sowing confusion and panic among the unsuspecting Elves. But the regiment was doubly betrayed, for the quisling servants of the Enemy had lied as well about the size of the Elvish force that had come from the North, and as the main body of their army crested a nearby hill, the Men of Gondor were greatly dismayed, for it was thrice the size they had been told and near equal in number to their own force." progressOverride="The Furthest Charge, page 14" itemId="1879177895" itemName="The Furthest Charge, Page 14"/>

<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This section of the book includes a spirited argument between philosophers over the nature of Oaths and the Fate of those who become bound up in them.&#10;&#10;On one side of the matter are those who argue that the words and intent of the Oathgiver serve to shape fate itself, tying them irrevokeably together in a bond that may guide the actions of those who are part of it in their endeavours -- and similarly hanging as a sword over the Oathgiver, promising a dread fate should that bond be violated.&#10;&#10;The other side of the debate includes scholars who reject the notion that mere words shape the world, claiming instead that it is the actions of the Oathgiver that decide the outcome of fate. They argue that the Oath itself simply acts to focus the will or prove the lie of the one who takes it, and that the shame of failure, corruption of the spirit, and the disillusionment of their peers serve more than adequately to turn the tides of fate against the oathbreaker without need of divine providence to mete out punishment." progressOverride="The Book of Oaths, page 8" itemId="1879177872" itemName="The Book of Oaths, Page 8"/>
<inventoryItem index="2" loreInfo="This page leads into a discussion at considerable depth of the fate of an ancient Elf who was a Lord among Lords, who set upon himself and his people an Oath so powerful and dire that it is believed to have shaped the course of entire ages of the world, and the fate of countless Elves, Men, and dwarves.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the argument remains quite abstract within these pages, as the scholars of Men who penned the work seem only to know of these events through legends and myths, and the Elves of that time were apparently not keen to discuss the subject openly.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, if the events described by the scholars are indeed founded even partially in truth, it suggests that the Oath taken by this Elf-lord may well have been the most powerful words ever to pass the lips of any being of Middle-earth, be they mortal or immortal, wizard or king." progressOverride="The Book of Oaths, page 9" itemId="1879177873" itemName="The Book of Oaths, Page 9"/>

The writer attempts to determine whether a creature such as a Dragon could ever truly be bound by an Oath, however granted, or whether they could indeed be bound as such, but would instead use their mastery of lies and deceit to craft an Oath such that the one to whom they granted it would find themselves bound instead.&#10;&#10;The arguments, while interesting, eventually become circular and insubstantial as it becomes clear that the writer had little experience in the subject of speaking with Dragons, yet was wise enough not to seek out experimental evidence with which to support his work...." progressOverride="The Book of Oaths, page 14" itemId="1879177874" itemName="The Book of Oaths, Page 14"/>

It states that while all Oaths bind, the strength of that bond and the fate that follows may have little to do with the gravity of the words spoken, and a great deal to do with the unforeseen events that then follow.&#10;&#10;In particular, the scholar points out the story of a simple and friendly Oath offered at the birthday of a minor noble of the houses of Númenor -- an Oath that in the course of time and events drew his house into a years-long war which served to destroy the fortunes of his family and saw him die a lonely pauper.&#10;&#10;Alas, it is impossible to say if the tale was a true one, or a cautionary fable devised by the author to strengthen his argument." progressOverride="The Book of Oaths, page 17" itemId="1879177843" itemName="The Book of Oaths, Page 17"/>

<inventoryItem index="0" loreInfo="The early sections of this book seem to focus on the importance of basic drills -- similar to many another warrior's guide, but the author goes into some depth on the purpose of these mindless activities and suggests some novel meditative techniques to be used before and after the drills to improve their efficacy." progressOverride="The Artisan Blade, page 2" itemId="1879177878" itemName="The Artisan Blade, Page 2"/>
<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="This page proves to be more of a text on the healing arts, than on fighting. The author cautions that the strain of such rigourous drills may injure a warrior ere he ever reaches the field of battle and suggests a particular regimen of herbal compresses and heated cloths to help the muscles and joints heal more quickly after the grueling exercises." progressOverride="The Artisan Blade, page 4" itemId="1879177879" itemName="The Artisan Blade, Page 4"/>
<inventoryItem index="2" loreInfo="Never have you seen such attention to detail in a warrior's treatise.&#10;&#10;The author has gone so far as the measure of strength with which a blow must land to rend an enemy's armour, be it leather, chain, or tempered dwarf-steel. He then goes into how one may train himself to gauge the strength of his own blows to ensure that the blow lands truly each time, with no waste of strength or motion." progressOverride="The Artisan Blade, page 6" itemId="1879177880" itemName="The Artisan Blade, Page 6"/>
<inventoryItem index="3" loreInfo="This page is covered with diagrams of the arm, displaying numerous positions of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, as well as their ranges of motion.&#10;&#10;It seems to be an exploration of the possible forms in which a weapon might be swung to its best effect." progressOverride="The Artisan Blade, page 9" itemId="1879177881" itemName="The Artisan Blade, Page 9"/>
<inventoryItem index="4" loreInfo="This page lists a series of weights that may be attached to one's blade or mace to gradually increase its weight and further strengthen the arm during practice drills. The author suggests a slow but unwaveringly steady series of increases, up to the point where the weights seem impractical for anyone who is not a troll to manage.&#10;&#10;You find yourself wondering a bit about the sincerity of the author, but so much of the book is gruelingly logical and methodical that you imagine he must really be serious. How many of his students actually survived this regimen may be a more pertinent question." progressOverride="The Artisan Blade, page 14" itemId="1879177882" itemName="The Artisan Blade, Page 14"/>
<inventoryItem index="5" loreInfo="This page is used to describe the training area that the author constructed for himself. It seems large and unsurprisingly spartan, focusing only on those necessities of the art of combat, foregoing virtually all other comforts or distractions.&#10;&#10;You doubt that this fellow got around to many festivals or had a lot of friends." progressOverride="The Artisan Blade, page 15" itemId="1879177883" itemName="The Artisan Blade, Page 15"/>
<inventoryItem index="6" loreInfo="This page is the first to discuss technique beyond the most basic of motions. It discusses the momentum of the weapon, stating that the student -- who presumably has dutifully followed all that came before -- must now learn how to retain the speed and power of his strikes, whether they strike wood, metal, flesh, or air as the opponent moves and blocks in turn.&#10;&#10;The warrior that is capable of keeping his weapon in motion throughout all these moments of battle will tire more slowly and retain the advantage as he forces his opponent to react again and again, rather than acting in turn." progressOverride="The Artisan Blade, page 17" itemId="1879177884" itemName="The Artisan Blade, Page 17"/>
<inventoryItem index="7" loreInfo="The author provides a summary of the training and drills offered throughout the book, tying them all together in the same clear and spartan fashion as all that came before.&#10;&#10;You find yourself believing that even a child could learn to fight masterfully following these methods -- assuming that said child had some troll's blood in his veins and a fanatical devotion to swordsmanship that most would consider unhealthily obsessive...." progressOverride="The Artisan Blade, page 26" itemId="1879177885" itemName="The Artisan Blade, Page 26"/>

At that time, Durin's Folk were scattered and greatly reduced in number, and the Guardian's role took on a much greater importance as the threat of goblins and Orcs to dwarf-settlements beneath the roots of the world became more and more common. The dwarves often settled for building powerful strongholds designed to make the approach to their cities, impervious to assault, manning them with skilled and powerful guardians to ensure that none would pass unchallenged.&#10;&#10;While the book itself is common enough, the owner of this copy seems to have scribbled copious notes within the margins of the pages -- notes containing an experience and insight to the art that even at a glance exceeds that of the original author.

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;This book is of Elvish origin, having been written so long ago that few of the Elves today were alive at the time of its writing. You cannot even guess at how old it actually is, as it seems to show few signs of age or decay. You cannot recognize the type of parchment it was written upon, nor what kind of ink could withstand the passage of so much time without fading. The main indication of its age and origin is the writing style which is in an extremely old form using ancient letters called Tengwar, which were created by the Noldor many ages ago. The main focus of the book is difficult to translate, but seems to centre around an ancient oath of battle that Elf-guardians might make in the midst of a desperate melee, in essence binding themselves and their enemies in a pact of battle and death that neither the oath-taker nor their sworn-enemies dared break.&#10;&#10;It is clear from the text that these oaths carried power beyond that of any simple cry to infuriate or trick one's enemies -- but the secret of the technique seems lost as several key pages have been carefully cut from the book, presumably by someone hoping to safeguard its secrets in an age long past.

<inventoryItem index="1" loreInfo="Another page of nearly indecipherable and ancient prose, it describes battle between two enemies as something other than a simple melee.&#10;&#10;Instead, the text describes battles between powerful foes as a form of ritual or dance (your translation here is uncertain) -- one that forms the basis for a bond between the two combatants that transcends the physical.&#10;&#10;You begin to suspect that the author was of a decidedly mystical outlook." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 7" itemId="1879177887" itemName="The Final Word, Page 7"/>
<inventoryItem index="2" loreInfo="Sticking to indescipherable prose, the author speaks of the greater tide of battle, wherein many foes stand across from each other hurling insult and threat before inevitably breaking upon each other. This aspect, too, he considers the foundation of a greater bond, both between the fellow warriors of each army, and between the two forces themselves as they steel themselves for battle.&#10;&#10;You remain unclear on the nature of this bond the author keeps referring to, but it is clearly the central theme of the work." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 13" itemId="1879177888" itemName="The Final Word, Page 13"/>
<inventoryItem index="3" loreInfo="This page is one of the few written in plain language, though the ancient tongue makes it difficult nevertheless.&#10;&#10;It speaks of more mundane subjects than some of the others, such as the crucial role of the guardian in maintaining control over the pace of battle, never allowing it to run away from them and become that portrait of meaningless chaos and noise that presages defeat." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 14" itemId="1879177889" itemName="The Final Word, Page 14"/>
<inventoryItem index="4" loreInfo="Another of the few pages that forego prose for plain language, this speaks to the strength of the guardian's defence, and the manner in which it permits them to find their way to the pulsing heart of the battle, a vantage from which one may express the greatest degree of control over the ebb and flow of the enemy's motion and morale." progressOverride="The Final Word, page 19" itemId="1879177890" itemName="The Final Word, Page 19"/>

<itemUsed index="1" loreInfo="The runes you found seemed to be very old indeed, and in style of ancient Arnorian script that few would readily recognize in these times. While you made out only a little of it, the inscription is likely an oath of fealty taken by Dúnedain to their lords.&#10;&#10;The Men of those days put great store in ceremony and oaths, and believed that to break one would bring a terrible curse upon the oathbreaker.&#10;&#10;Few Men put much store in ritual and ceremony these days -- save for the Rangers of the North, who are rumoured to have descended from those very Dúnedain who once ruled Arnor.

Those who remained loyal to the old kings banded together under the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain and became the forebears of the Rangers who walk these lands today, or so it is rumoured.&#10;&#10;In those days there were still evil Men and worse who walked these lands and there was a battle few Men alive today remember.

Bree-town itself was built upon a crossroads between Arthedain and its sister kingdom Cardolan to the east. Once they were all one great kingdom, stretching all across the north, but the folly of Men first sundered them, then set them against each other until one after another they fell over the long years of the Third Age.&#10;&#10;There are some folk who still remember the tales of Arthedain, but you suspect that the crest may be of particular importance to the Rangers, for it is said that they are descended from that bloodline." itemId="1879071995" itemName="Ancient Crest"/>

<itemUsed index="2" loreInfo="The flower you found marks the place where the Entwife Dorollin passed into the Old Forest, perhaps forever.&#10;&#10;She was among the largest of her kind, taller than any other, for the essence of all that grows was at the core of her nature. Her gardens were sprawling places wrapped in great vines, and enormous trees cast their shade upon acres of fertile ground.&#10;&#10;She gave herself to the Old Forest to ensure that it would grow great enough to protect itself from the incursion of evil such as Orcs and thoughtless Men.&#10;&#10;Some folk say that one day they will awaken and emerge from the forest - but no one knows when that might be." itemId="1879072001" itemName="Dorollin's Flower"/>

The flower you have found marks the place where she entered the forest, and she has not been seen since.&#10;&#10;Alas, the Old Forest has oft been harmed by Men or intruded upon by darker powers, and so it is said that her heart lies muted, and she sleeps more deeply than her sisters.

<itemUsed index="6" loreInfo="The flower of Braiglad is seen as a warning by superstitious folk who would dare the depths of the Old Forest.

Her jewels were said to be the petals of flowers, and while they would last but a short season -- unlike the gems of the Noldor which are forever -- their beauty far surpassed that of any object carved of stone or crystal. This passing beauty was such that it endured no greed, and so the vanity of evil hearts could neither possess nor endure it.&#10;&#10;Those who are fond of the story say that she will awaken some day when beauty can again be shared amongst all the creatures of Arda without fear of despoilment or jealous vanity." itemId="1879072006" itemName="Merillif's Flower"/>

The last four pages of this book can be found on enemies scattered across Forochel, Moria, and the Misty Mountains.&#10;&#10;Written some two hundred years ago, \qBullroarer's Boy\q was a fanciful journal kept by Haldemar Took, one of the younger sons of Bandobras Took. After the Battle of Greenfields, Haldemar became a Warden of the Shire, and told many Tall (or rather short) Tales of adventures beyond the Bounds, many of them humorous accounts of battle against goblins and trolls and other beasts, some wholly imagined. Though much of the book is whimsy, there is truth at the core that any Warden would value. Sadly, the three known copies of the book were all stolen, suspiciously, within a week of one another nearly a century ago." objectives="">

You met with Dulgabêth, the former Mouth of Sauron, and listened to his offer of peace.

After bringing the Black Book of Mordor to Gandalf and delivering word of his son to King Thorin, you learned that the Zhélruka passed into the Grey Mountains; unwilling to shed dwarf-blood, Durin followed them instead, vowing to protect the Men of Dale from the possibility of Zhélruka aggression. When you finally caught up to Durin, his heart had been moved by the chill air of the mountains, and he desired to prove himself a worthy son and heir to King Thorin, though it mean risking the ire of Karazgar, the Weeping Warrior." progressOverride="Complete 'Where the Shadows Lie, Chapter 8'" achievableId="1879369407"/>

<questComplete index="0" loreInfo="You learned of a series of intertwining rumours that confounded the Men of Lake-town and Dale. Who or what is the Herald of Winter? Has Vethúg Wintermind grown weary of his hoards in the Ered Mithrin, or does another of the Gúrzyul come to spread fear and destruction in the North?" progressOverride="Complete 'Heralds of a New Age'" achievableId="1879365386"/>
<questComplete index="1" loreInfo="You learned that the agents of the Weeping Warrior have been gathering cold-drakelings in Lake-town under the cover of night. After eavesdropping on a conversation between a smuggler and one of Karazgar's servants, you learned that not only does Karazgar hope to use the drakelings to bolster his strength, but also to send a message to the Herald of Winter and the North itself. You also discovered that Karazgar travelled into Eryn Lasgalen, but his purposes remain unclear." progressOverride="Complete 'Loose Tongues in Lake-town'" achievableId="1879365387"/>
<questComplete index="2" loreInfo="At King Thorin's request, you sought an audience with King Thranduil. You offered him a token of peace from the dwarves of Erebor, and delivered a warning that Karazgar now stalked the realm of the Elves. King Thranduil prepared his scouts and you aided in directing them to seek Karazgar among the forest of Eryn Lasgalen. What will their searches reveal?" progressOverride="Complete 'Kings of Wood and Stone'" achievableId="1879365388"/>
<questComplete index="3" loreInfo="Despite learning that Karazgar may have returned to Caras Tilion, King Thranduil was forced to turn his attention to another matter. The Old Mother, Iphantemel, was revealed in Torech Emel, and the time had come at last to claim vengeance upon her for the destruction of Caras Tilion and the blighting of Mirkwood. Far from the hale foe Thranduil once faced, Iphantemel was old and bloated in her excess and she seemed to welcome her death. The spiders were at last purged from Eryn Lasgalen, but only because Ungwetári called her children to the Ephel Dúath for some terrible purpose. King Thranduil became suspicious of Karazgar's intentions in travelling to Caras Tilion and vowed to seek him with a small company of Elves." progressOverride="Complete 'Bane of the Elvenking'" achievableId="1879365392"/>
<questComplete index="4" loreInfo="After King Thranduil travelled to Caras Tilion, he was beset by the forces of Karazgar. King Thranduil battled Karazgar in single combat, but before the tide of battle turned, he found himself awoken outside Felegoth as if from a trance. Fearing that Karazgar sought the power of the mysterious Green Lady, King Thranduil sent you to Caras Tilion to challenge Karazgar. You discovered the aftermath of a battle between Elves and the Men of Mordor, but Karazgar left only rust in his wake. The Green Lady was revealed, but her intentions remain unclear. What powers does she possess? Is she of the same kind as the Huntsman of Dunland?" progressOverride="Complete 'Karazgar's Gambit'" achievableId="1879365393"/>
<questComplete index="5" loreInfo="After the darkness of Mirkwood at last began to recede, Tárasánë, the Green Lady, revealed herself in Caras Tilion. In a powerful vision, Tárasánë revealed that Vethúg Wintermind will come to Erebor, but as merely a harbinger of the true Herald of Winter. Although Tárasánë would not speak of the Herald of Winter's name, she told you that the Herald of Winter once served the will of Morgoth and has dwelt in Middle-earth since the Elders Days. You returned to King Thranduil with these troubling tidings, and he sent word to the Queen Regent and King Under the Mountain." progressOverride="Complete 'Of Dreams and Desires'" achievableId="1879365390"/>
<questComplete index="6" loreInfo="At long last, Karazgar revealed his designs in Esgaroth-of-old. The broken remains of the cold-drakelings his agents captured from the furthest reaches of the Ered Mithrin had been laid bare among the bones of Smaug the Golden. It was a deception to enrage the greater drakes in the service of the Herald of Winter and turn their ire against the Elves, Men, and dwarves of the North. A dying cold-drake revealed that one of his kin escaped Karazgar's wrath in Esgaroth-of-old and made for the Ered Mithrin to deliver a warning to the Herald of Winter. Despite the efforts of the leaders of the North, it seems the vile plot of the Weeping Warrior has succeeded." progressOverride="Complete 'Treachery in Esgaroth'" achievableId="1879365391"/>
<questComplete index="7" loreInfo="After you revealed to King Thorin that Vethúg Wintermind seeks to set siege to Erebor, he prepared to rally the forces of the North to repel the legendary cold-drake. Fearful that Vethúg does indeed serve one greater, he has resolved to slay the cold-drake and avenge his ancestors who dwelt in the Ered Mithrin. After an ill-advised attempt at humour, King Thorin requested that you deliver word to the leaders in the North. Although some offered help only begrudgingly, it seems the North remains united against the servants of the Enemy." progressOverride="Complete 'An Ill Wind Blows'" achievableId="1879365389"/>
<questComplete index="8" loreInfo="While the rest of the North braced for the coming of Vethúg Wintermind, Dís summoned King Thorin III to Ravenhill. To their surprise, the raven-chief, Arcah, had returned from far-off lands and wished to speak with the new King Under the Mountain. After agreeing to honour the old ways between their peoples, Arcah sent her ravens far and wide to spy on both Karazgar and Vethúg Wintermind." progressOverride="Complete 'An Unexpected Summons'" achievableId="1879368161"/>
<questComplete index="9" loreInfo="Fearing that you were misled by the visions of the Green Lady, King Thorin III advised you to seek the counsel of King Thranduil. In turn, King Thranduil suggested you seek the counsel of Lady Galadriel and the power of the Mirror. After travelling to Caras Galadhon, Lady Galadriel did not believe that Karazgar could have come so far south to enter the ruins of Dol Guldur beneath the notice of the Galadhrim. Lady Galadriel consulted the Mirror, but again saw no sign of Karazgar in Dol Dhannen, the name now given to Dol Guldur. Still, she felt that something remained beyond her sight and thought long on what was to be done." progressOverride="Complete 'The Lady and the Mirror'" achievableId="1879368157"/>
<questComplete index="10" loreInfo="After much deliberation, Lady Galadriel travelled to Dol Dhannen with Lord Celeborn, King Thranduil, Sigileth, and you. Your exploration of the ruins of Dol Dhannen nearly proved fruitless until you discovered a small passage leading down into the shadowed tunnels of Gostador. As Lady Galadriel expected, you did not find Karazgar in its depths. However, a great evil still lingered in Gostador and you witnessed shadowy impressions of Karazgar's final dealings with Sauron in Dol Guldur. You learned that Karazgar was promised the entirety of the North once the peoples there were driven out, and that the Weeping Warrior could subjugate or destroy any of the dragons that remained in that realm. You also learned that Hrímil Frost-heart defied Sauron and devoured one of the Dwarf-rings in spite. Following these revelations, you returned to Erebor and informed King Thorin III that Karazgar may still lurk nearby." progressOverride="Complete 'Whispers in the Pits'" achievableId="1879368158"/>
<questComplete index="11" loreInfo="The raven-chief, Arcah, called back her ravens from their spying, but not all made the return journey safely. You rescued a wounded raven from swift cold-drakelings that pursued it onto the slopes of Erebor, and soon after, it was able to fly to Ravenhill. However, the tidings it brought did not bode well for the peoples of the North. Vethúg Wintermind had begun his flight from the Grey Mountains, and he would soon lay his vengeance of upon the North." progressOverride="Complete 'Through the Eyes of Ravens'" achievableId="1879368155"/>
<questComplete index="12" loreInfo="After learning that Vethúg Wintermind flies for Erebor, the peoples of the North began to ready their defences in earnest. You aided the peoples of Dale, Lake-town, and Felegoth in preparing for battle and defending their homes." progressOverride="Complete 'Many Preparations'" achievableId="1879368156"/>
<questComplete index="13" loreInfo="Like the coming of a great storm, Vethúg Wintermind descended upon Erebor in rage and vengeance. Many peoples of the North battled and fell, but in the end, Vethúg sustained a grave wound and flew for the Grey Mountains in defeat." progressOverride="Complete 'Scion of Winter'" achievableId="1879368164"/>
<questComplete index="14" loreInfo="In the aftermath of the battle at Erebor, it was revealed by the ravens that Karazgar pursued the wounded Vethúg Wintermind into the Grey Mountains. Much to the dismay of his kinfolk, King Thorin III decreed that no expeditions shall be made into the Grey Mountains for he, Erna, and Thranduil think it wise to remain uninvolved in the conflict between Karazgar and Vethúg Wintermind now that they have left the North." progressOverride="Complete 'Rust and Rime'" achievableId="1879368165"/>
<questComplete index="15" loreInfo="Despite his edict, King Thorin III has heard troubling rumours regarding the forming of an expedition to reclaim Thikil-gundu, the Steel Keep, from the dragons and Orcs of the Grey Mountains. Every dwarf you spoke to denied such an expedition, but King Thorin III remained unconvinced. After talking to the adventurous Dori and learning that he has no intent to defy the King Under the Mountain, he asked you to talk to Nori about a group of dwarves who came to the coffers in the night. To the surprise of all in Erebor, Nori departed and led an expedition into the Grey Mountains. King Thorin III was furious, but he would not violate his own edict. The fate of the expedition to Thikil-gundu is Nori's burden to bear." progressOverride="Complete 'Trouble Under the Mountain'" achievableId="1879368163"/>

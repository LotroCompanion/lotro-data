Repository for misc. LOTRO related data. This includes XML data and icons for:
- traits
- recipes

In the future, it may contain:
- quests
- titles
- emotes
- mounts
- travels
- skills
- ...

Note that items, relics, deeds, maps are managed in separate, dedicated repositories.
Character data (races, classes, starts stats, stats derivations) and progressions are managed in the repository for lotro-companion.
This is clearly the weight of history. All these could be managed inside this repository.

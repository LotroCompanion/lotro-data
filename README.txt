- emotes
- commons (progressions, colors, factions, stats)
- character data (races, classes, starts stats, stats derivations, trait points)

Note that items, relics, deeds, maps are managed in separate, dedicated repositories.
This is clearly the weight of history. All these could be managed inside this repository.
